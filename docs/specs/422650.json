{"gameId":422650,"name":"Port Royal: A Miniature Skirmish Game set in the Searover's Caribbean","description":"Port Royal&nbsp;is a campaign based, tactical, small-scale warband-sized skirmish wargame that is easy and fast to learn and play, loosely based on the historical events following the 1692 earthquake that devastated the island of Jamaica. &#10;In Port Royal, players take control of small companies of pirates, privateers, Native Americans, African Maroons, or local government forces as they battle against opponents for their share of the plunder that litter the ruins of the place. Players will gain loot, experience, and infamy between games while growing their piratical expertise. But take heed! The ruins are fraught with dangers: falling buildings, wild animals, desperate civilians, and opposing companies can bring a quick end to members of your company!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7zL7hqhIjhHn0cEHL2E8XQ__original/img/50OQCm07ACA6S1P5KXQzz7N1_mU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8248243.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7zL7hqhIjhHn0cEHL2E8XQ__thumb/img/3xNPULjcYSgkJHt4QnlIy-VUbSk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8248243.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Critical Hits and Failures","Dice Rolling","Interrupts","Line of Sight","Measurement Movement","Role Playing","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Storytelling"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.33333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Mike Tunez"],"publishers":["Firelock Games"],"artists":["Lilian Figueroa","Ian Hosfeld"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
