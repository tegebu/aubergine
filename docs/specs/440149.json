{"gameId":440149,"name":"Agricola: Dead Harvest","description":"You reload your rifle, eyes locked on the approaching horde. They&rsquo;re close. Too close. Yesterday, you lost Tom, but there&rsquo;s no time to mourn&mdash;only time to fight. Without the harvest, you won&rsquo;t survive the winter. A broken radio crackles from the porch, playing &quot;Heaven is a Place on Earth.&quot; Ironic. This feels like hell. The undead press forward, ready to trample the sprouting pumpkins. Not today, shamblers. Not today.&#10;&#10;Agricola: Dead Harvest reimagines Uwe Rosenberg&rsquo;s iconic farming game in a thrilling post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Farmers must defend their land from the unyielding pest while managing resources to endure. Strategic planning, intense survival mechanics, and relentless undead threats create a unique fusion of farming and horror, offering high replayability and a fresh challenge for both Agricola veterans and newcomers.&#10;&#10;Can you protect your farm, sustain your people, and survive the harvest?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QRsJIyHxrHtMm9Q_e_F79Q__original/img/E3rB0XxXm6iq00IgHINkYy9OAcQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8735478.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QRsJIyHxrHtMm9Q_e_F79Q__thumb/img/yU2a8nbpPLYOKwMY9ibuqxrZ0qU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8735478.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Automatic Resource Growth","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2027,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7,"rank":-1,"designers":["Uwe Rosenberg","Tomasz Zawadzki"],"publishers":["Awaken Realms","Lookout Games"],"artists":["Jakub Dzikowski","Patryk Jędraszek","Ewa Labak","Pamela Łuniewska"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
