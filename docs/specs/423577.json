{"gameId":423577,"name":"Valheim: The Board Game","description":"Valheim is a 1-4 player co-operative board game in which survival depends on teamwork and strategy. Gather your fellow companions and venture forward to explore, build, collect resources, forge weapons, equip sturdy armor, battle enemies, and carve your path towards facing the ultimate evil. Take on a role in which you help tailor the adventure to your liking. The fate of everyone lies in your hands!&#10;&#10;Your objective is to summon and defeat the Forsaken, but you will need to prepare before facing the challenge. To get ready, you&rsquo;ll need to gather materials and craft gear, upgrade your house, and defend yourself against creatures while doing so.&#10;&#10;Every session of Valheim is featured around a unique mission. Each features a map layout, a story introduction, a mission objective, and a few guidelines. To summon the Forsaken and progress to the endgame, you will need to complete the objective. If you fail to do so, you lose.&#10;&#10;There is an option to play &ldquo;campaign mode,&rdquo; where you progress through a series of scenarios, or to design your own scenarios.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dfrk5c1iEE1OQnURm8ywJg__original/img/NAJBEefdewTo8mhyuTChYmEf1v4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8269437.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dfrk5c1iEE1OQnURm8ywJg__thumb/img/UBu_Urua1KWzPWHqryzTIEVOtI4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8269437.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Die Icon Resolution","Events","Finale Ending","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.4,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ole Steiness"],"publishers":["MOOD Publishing"],"artists":["Michael Koudal","Mats Minnhagen","Jacob MÃ¸ller","Kira Rasmussen","Jonas Springborg"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
