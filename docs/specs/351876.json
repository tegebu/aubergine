{"gameId":351876,"name":"I, Napoleon","description":"I, Napoleon is a solitaire historical role-playing card game in which you step into the boots of Captain Buonaparte (as he still was) in the year 1793. Louis XVI has just gone to the guillotine, the brothers Robespierre control the destiny of France, and all Europe has joined French Royalists to take down France, end the Revolution, and restore peace and safety for the hereditary principles that have underlain society for 1000 years.&#10;&#10;As an ambitious but unknown young artillery officer, who speaks French with a Corsican accent, you would seem to be an unlikely agent of destiny. Can you harness a brilliant mind, titanic energies, and a sometimes terrifying charisma to leave your mark on history? Or will you die a minor footnote in the story of France?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g5s5DRAtNSpdeaqom-Wxrw__original/img/9Wgr128ZdSx5lMhReJSklqtMwMc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7812611.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g5s5DRAtNSpdeaqom-Wxrw__thumb/img/6iszgnyfSL-xRCdwDIRVSTuA_98=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7812611.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1,"playingTime":240,"mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Role Playing","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.66084,"averageRating":8.03436,"rank":6533,"designers":["Ted Raicer"],"publishers":["GMT Games"],"artists":["Jacques Onfroy de Br√©ville"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":10,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
