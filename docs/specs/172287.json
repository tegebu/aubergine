{"gameId":172287,"name":"Champions of Midgard","description":"Champions of Midgard is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!&#10;&#10;Placing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VJwOnMF5vwJg2Yaq6ozn3Q__original/img/iEgr80D4UtP0x_WQUYSB60JwGJ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2869714.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VJwOnMF5vwJg2Yaq6ozn3Q__thumb/img/Ms3h8cBxGzfcKB16q1KPOsmnoG8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2869714.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Set Collection","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2015,"bggRating":7.46133,"averageRating":7.73593,"rank":124,"designers":["Ole Steiness"],"publishers":["Grey Fox Games","Corax Games","Czacha Games","Don't Panic Games","Ediciones MasQueOca","Games Warehouse","Lavka Games"],"artists":["Jose David Lanza Cebrian","Víctor Pérez Corbella"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":130,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":19,"recommended":126,"notRecommended":53,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":64,"recommended":119,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":149,"recommended":40,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":13,"recommended":21,"notRecommended":74,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
