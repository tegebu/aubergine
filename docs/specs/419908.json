{"gameId":419908,"name":"Katmai: The Bears of Brooks River","description":"Katmai: The Bears of Brooks River is a dynamic two-player card game of competitive area control, careful planning, and very hungry bears.&#10;&#10;Every summer, dozens of ravenous brown bears descend upon the majestic Brooks River in the Katmai region of Alaska. Here they gorge themselves on its summer bounty of salmon that swim up the beautiful, glacial-fed rivers of the Alaskan wilderness.&#10;&#10;In Katmai, you will be playing bears to advantageous fishing spots along Brooks River in order to gain dominance, satisfy challenges, and catch delicious salmon. As the fishing spots fill up, you will need to choose your bears carefully, triggering unique abilities that will allow you to take advantage of situations and outwit your hungry opponent. Katmai weaves together simple mechanisms with rich decision making to create an experience that is contemplative, competitive, and tense. Winter approaches, and the wilderness is yours. It's time to feast!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M61DvkIkP9qslgR1ZXeJ9g__original/img/r3VK2tYOje1jdXgJneaIti3_2k0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8233882.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M61DvkIkP9qslgR1ZXeJ9g__thumb/img/tCuuWv1_yTLPVqKvkTF8hc8ljLk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8233882.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.47917,"rank":-1,"designers":["Peter Ridgeway"],"publishers":["Osprey Games"],"artists":["Tom Lopez"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
