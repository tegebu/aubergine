{"gameId":305682,"name":"Rolling Realms","description":"In the early days of the coronavirus, a time of self-isolation for many people, Jamey decided to create an infinitely scaling roll-and-write game to teach and play with people around the world via Facebook Live.&#10;&#10;In Rolling Realms, players compete to earn the most stars in a series of minigames over 3 rounds. This is a roll-and-write game, meaning that players will write on the game components using dry-erase markers.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player rolls 2 dice, and all players use the dice results on their realm cards to generate resources and earn stars. After 3 rounds, the player with the most stars wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5TZ5YfDo_r9vNNvWTl_pzw__original/img/YxcHzKCiiRq68K7Fd3qsUp-xhaE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6313647.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5TZ5YfDo_r9vNNvWTl_pzw__thumb/img/oKM1pAH4fCa7LCNluCqr9qNOq4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6313647.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Bingo","Dice Rolling","Paper-and-Pencil","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.73314,"averageRating":7.00431,"rank":4465,"designers":["Jamey Stegmaier"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games"],"artists":["Marius Petrescu","Miles Bensky"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":7,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
