{"gameId":416059,"name":"Gardlings","description":"Cleverly build your garden. Harvest gems and enrich your seed bag with new, amazing creatures so your next garden can grow even more abundant. Combine the unique abilities of your creatures, and be the first to acquire the victory trophy.&#10;&#10;Each round in Gardlings, all players simultaneously build their garden in front of themselves. You do this by drawing and placing tiles from your bag. You may stop drawing tiles at any time because if you draw too many gnomes, they will steal gems from you. At the end of the round, use any gems you matched in your garden to buy a new tile, then return all of your tiles to your bag to prepare for the next round. Each tile features potential ways to match gems, as well as a creature with a special ability. Your garden will grow larger and better each round, and the puzzle of placing tiles will become increasingly complex.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to match enough gems to buy the victory tile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fUOKaaWYVnBagDKj4AQb2Q__original/img/hatQoun0oFaitZLGBDsJqDXbFTM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8075053.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fUOKaaWYVnBagDKj4AQb2Q__thumb/img/R3VrUgbo06v0PxEYQv4HVx0_G-U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8075053.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Push Your Luck","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.53061,"averageRating":7.71912,"rank":14987,"designers":["Kristian Amundsen Østby","Maria Østby"],"publishers":["Alion – by Dr Ø"],"artists":["Gjermund Bohne"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
