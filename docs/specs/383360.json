{"gameId":383360,"name":"Flock Together","description":"Flock Together is a beautifully immersive cooperative experience for 1-5 players. During the game, each player takes on the role of a unique chicken with asymmetric abilities and works together to drive off the invading predators before the third season ends.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players choose their own strategy to progress their cause by selecting two of their eight available actions. Along the way, players will also have to manage leveling up, predator loot drops, traveling grubs, and adverse weather conditions. However, players must plan carefully, because as the seasons change, every predator that is still alive grows stronger and gains new abilities.&#10;&#10;With eleven asymmetric characters to play and ten unique predators to defeat, Flock Together offers immense variability that can be enjoyed with quick turns and an experience that lasts 25 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aCAwFw1Tj7X9EMNyJxmnXg__original/img/H420zXcbTjLJmkOV0H94_76_HZQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7450871.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aCAwFw1Tj7X9EMNyJxmnXg__thumb/img/rt4r27rp9GSgcKffzr02yRgIaXE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7450871.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":125,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.70445,"averageRating":7.40603,"rank":5755,"designers":["Matt Mundy"],"publishers":["Sea Cow Games"],"artists":["Andrew Bosley"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
