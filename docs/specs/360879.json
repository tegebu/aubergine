They must collect and store emotional resources in their memory bank which they will use to unlock emotions from their mind, then place these emotion tiles on the main game board.&#10;&#10;Emotion tiles can be connected in networks of like emotions to score points. The player with the most emotions in each region can score big points at the end of the game, but only if they manage to unlock and place a claim tile belonging to the region they wish to score.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3FcKdodsE6Ukne2Lx6jclA__original/img/OLE-FPXaGj6cu_pC9rw9Jjtx3ag=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6811417.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3FcKdodsE6Ukne2Lx6jclA__thumb/img/uxORN2Cq--CCwMCO7IufeYx-dms=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6811417.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Pattern Building","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":5.22222,"rank":-1,"designers":["Michael Kiesling","Wolfgang Kramer"],"publishers":["Game Brewer"],"artists":["Anastasia Cartovenco"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
