{"gameId":395512,"name":"Bunny Boom","description":"Bunnies are everywhere! It's an invasion, and nothing seems to be able to stop the proliferation of these adorable little beasts!  Madness has taken hold of the area, and no one wants to be caught with all these rabbits!&#10;&#10;In a game of Bunny Boom, you try to pass the bunny problem on to other players!  To do this, you must place cards from your hand in order to push the rabbits as far as possible and attract opponents to pick up more bunnies than you! You also cause BUNNY BOOM!  The game gets more intense each time an opponent places a new card, which may force you to collect more bunnies!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player who finishes with the fewest bunnies wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tujltauBKkajXRAcj0Nrkw__original/img/xrrL3Y0oEVOgzZMCp2Rj0X9vxr8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7985073.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tujltauBKkajXRAcj0Nrkw__thumb/img/AoUMkTRcdMZbTcWDieqt50cL2Nw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7985073.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Area Movement","Multi-Use Cards","Take That"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.49213,"averageRating":5.58077,"rank":25383,"designers":["Guime"],"publishers":["Ruse.Games"],"artists":["Andrew Bosley"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
