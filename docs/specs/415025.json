{"gameId":415025,"name":"Sprocketforge","description":"In Sprocketforge, players are artificers building a factory with enchanted gears to produce mana and complete orders to earn renown. Players will add, upgrade, and swap gears in their factory to create an efficient system.&#10;&#10;However, mana is messy and clogs up your vents, requiring players to balance earning points with keeping their machine clean. The noble houses of Sprocketforge will reward the factories with the cleanest system as players vie for favor to earn more points and additional actions.&#10;&#10;Be the player with the most renown at the end of the game to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/783jEwZUnHRnydh56xJHyQ__original/img/vMglPAQU6S3QZFs5_abnbgGlmgI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8699633.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/783jEwZUnHRnydh56xJHyQ__thumb/img/pauz3p8fT7oed9fq4AtFZNWMi6o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8699633.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Contracts","Follow","Hidden Victory Points","Income","Market","Modular Board","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.85714,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ananda Guneratne"],"publishers":["Sophisticated Cerberus Games, LLC"],"artists":["Tyler Edlin"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
