{"gameId":290236,"name":"Canvas","description":"In Canvas, you play as a painter competing in an art competition. Players will collect art cards, layering 3 of them together to create their own unique Painting. Each card contains a piece of artwork as well as a set of icons used during scoring. Icons will be revealed or hidden based on the way players choose to layer the cards making for an exciting puzzle. Paintings are scored based on a set of Scoring cards which will change each game. Once players have created and scored 3 paintings the game ends.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may take an Art card or make a painting. Art cards are selected from a row of cards in the center of play. Each of these cards has a cost associated with their position. After selecting an Art card you must pay its cost by placing an Inspiration token on each of the cards to its left. If you do not have enough Inspiration tokens, you may not select that card. Any tokens on the card you have selected are kept for future turns. The far left card costs no Inspiration tokens to take.&#10;&#10;If you have three or more Art cards you may chose to make a painting. Select 3 of your art cards, arrange them in any order and then score them by comparing the visible icons on your painting to the Scoring conditions.&#10;&#10;Once all players have made 3 paintings the game ends.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZYrTfjxGMsRIF_4fKIYLlg__original/img/5QdXtTs3WsKUuSMI-e8z6xUa0is=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5941327.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZYrTfjxGMsRIF_4fKIYLlg__thumb/img/9P2mV1jBKfHGhQGG8J1apykALNc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5941327.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Hand Management","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Layering","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.89134,"averageRating":7.79903,"rank":2968,"designers":["Jeff Chin","Andrew Nerger"],"publishers":["Road To Infamy Games","GateOnGames"],"artists":["Luan Huynh"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
