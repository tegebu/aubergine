{"gameId":424573,"name":"Pergola","description":"In Pergola, players develop their gardens, grow new plants, and attract insects and small animals. On their turn, a player chooses one of the four available tools, picks the presented items, and arranges them in their garden. Then they perform the action corresponding to the chosen tool. Since players have a lot of freedom in arranging plants in their gardens, after fifteen rounds each garden looks completely different and scores differently. The player who accumulates the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uZk1zNLrFWOtYzmgUSZBog__original/img/Nn_WIdQFmDDFOGbBwy-3vDERQWM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8515455.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uZk1zNLrFWOtYzmgUSZBog__thumb/img/VKW4A90go5zZ_aU6cIuRIICSpbU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8515455.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.56319,"averageRating":7.76904,"rank":11270,"designers":["Michał Gołąb Gołębiowski","Przemek Wojtkowiak"],"publishers":["Rebel Studio","Gém Klub Kft."],"artists":["Karolina Kijak"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
