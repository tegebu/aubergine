{"gameId":324513,"name":"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns â€“ The Game","description":"In the solitaire Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Board Game, you play &quot;The World's Greatest Detective&quot;, who's been pulled back from retirement into a gritty Gotham. Do everything you can to beat back a relentless tide of ruthless mutants, cops, and press looking to bring you down. Instead of traditional leveling up, this is a game of attrition. An old Batman tries to survive one final gauntlet, facing old and new villains &mdash; such as Two Face, Billy Berserk, and The Joker &mdash; and even his most powerful ally, The Man of Steel himself.&#10;&#10;The game is playable as standalone &quot;missions&quot; or one epic playthrough in which the results of each mission carry over to the next.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I3C94MCAyIEXakYMy-jwcQ__original/img/j_64GqFdHneQF9PpYTf8tbAiHfA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7077004.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I3C94MCAyIEXakYMy-jwcQ__thumb/img/L3o1MmNoncUJ6rmW-1nSAJmgvSg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7077004.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.66695,"averageRating":7.92176,"rank":5772,"designers":["Daryl Andrews","Morgan Dontanville"],"publishers":["Cryptozoic Entertainment","Don't Panic Games","Gen-X Games"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":7,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
