{"gameId":321563,"name":"Inis: Big Box","description":"Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis).&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game, you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;&#236;&#157;&#180;&#235;&#139;&#136;&#236;&#138;&#164;: &#235;&#185;&#133; &#235;&#176;&#149;&#236;&#138;&#164;, a.k.a.
