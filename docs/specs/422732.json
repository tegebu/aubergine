{"gameId":422732,"name":"Agent Avenue","description":"Agent Avenue is a competitive card game for 2-4 players that combines bluffing, strategic set collection, and a race to uncover your opponent's identity. Set in a colorful anthropomorphic world, players assume the roles of retired spies in a suburban neighborhood, outsmarting each other with cards that can score points or trigger special effects.&#10;&#10;Utilize a unique &quot;I split, you choose&quot; mechanic to play one card face-up and one face-down each turn. Your opponent chooses one, influencing both your strategies. Cards feature different agents and tools that impact scoring and game progress on a track, advancing the &quot;catch me&quot; race to uncover the opposing spy.&#10;&#10;Beautifully illustrated by Fanny-Pastor Berlie, the game's art brings to life a quirky neighborhood of animal spies. The game includes over 50 cards, a custom game board, and meeples.&#10;&#10;Outwit your opponents by strategically collecting agent sets and effectively using spy tools. The game ends when a player successfully uncovers their opponent, combining both strategic depth and bluffing elements.&#10;&#10;Perfect for those who love a mix of strategy and lighthearted competition, &quot;Agent Avenue&quot; challenges you to think like a spy and act like a friendly neighbor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qC5YwZANir1Cmg6d-1UUpQ__original/img/26YgtJFY_7vKONVD87cHDb1pWRs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8427963.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qC5YwZANir1Cmg6d-1UUpQ__thumb/img/QFSJbQfLQNrItkY_bQEzn71qYZ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8427963.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Race","Set Collection","Track Movement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":10,"rank":-1,"designers":["Christian Kudahl","Laura Kudahl"],"publishers":["Nerdlab Games"],"artists":["Fanny Pastor Berlie"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
