Decide whether you want to use the card as an extension to your fields (increasing your ability to grow olives, grain, or grapes), as an extension to your farm (increasing the number of pigs you can house, the deliveries you can make, or the coins you will earn each round), as a market barrow (providing a personal contract you can fulfill for valuable rewards), or as a hired helper (each providing a unique and powerful ability to improve your actions).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Round&#10;&#10;Each game round follows a consistent and simple structure.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Farm Phase&#10;         Play a farm card (optional)&#10;         Draw new card(s)&#10;         Take income&#10;         Farm growth (harvest goods and pigs)&#10;         Purchase roof markers (optional)&#10;    &#10;     Revenue Phase&#10;         Roll revenue dice&#10;         Draft a revenue die and perform the associated action (in turn order; repeated once)&#10;         Common action (undrafted revenue die)&#10;    &#10;     Transportation Phase&#10;         Choose donkey marker&#10;         Advance on siesta track and reset turn order&#10;         Deliver goods to common markets in the village, or to fulfill personal contracts&#10;    &#10;     Scoring Phase&#10;         Score victory points based on your position on the siesta track&#10;         Reset the siesta track&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the sixth game round, the game ends, wherafter the players convert remaining farm goods and coin into victory points.
