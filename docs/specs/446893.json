{"gameId":446893,"name":"Realm of Reckoning","description":"The realm was once a magnificent afterlife, ruled by the Queen of All Souls and held together by the Five Pillars&mdash;relics embodying the land&rsquo;s guiding forces. But civil war shattered the Queen, scattered the relics, and plunged the realm into ruin, leaving five warring factions vying for dominance.&#10;&#10;In Realm of Reckoning, players compete in the great reckonings. Each turn, you&rsquo;ll draft action cards, gaining unique abilities and collecting sets of artifacts. These cards can also trigger reckonings, forcing players to spend resources in a high-stakes struggle for power. The victors claim the power to shape the game&rsquo;s victory conditions.&#10;&#10;As players build monuments, reclaim relics, and maneuver for control, they determine how power is measured, and in turn...  the fate of the afterlife.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xElMYLyj1pqtCIOhRNzA9w__original/img/uQSPJKFbAsnhXf_gVKPnRyYMXK8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8899476.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xElMYLyj1pqtCIOhRNzA9w__thumb/img/f1F4gQbvIXlwqCl0T11e7qcEPu4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8899476.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction: Sealed Bid","Closed Drafting","Voting"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.29375,"rank":-1,"designers":["Max Anderson","Zac Dixon","Austin Harrison"],"publishers":["IV Studio (IV Games)"],"artists":["Reece Parker"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
