{"gameId":312804,"name":"Pendulum","description":"In Pendulum, each player is a powerful, unique noble vying to succeed the Timeless King as the true ruler of D&uuml;nya. Players command their workers, execute stratagems, and expand the provinces in their domain in real time to gain resources and move up the four victory tracks: power, prestige, popularity, and legendary achievement.&#10;&#10;Players must use actual time as a resource in managing their strategy to best their opponents, using time on different action types and balancing it with time spent planning and analyzing. The winner will be the player who manages and invests their time most effectively and who builds the best engine, not the player who acts the quickest.&#10;&#10;Pendulum is the highest-rated protoype in the history of the Stonemaier Games Design Day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kgypcFnQosrcwYx5Jluafg__original/img/NahdiNIC18lj_BsU_9Ju7Hb9mek=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5507191.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kgypcFnQosrcwYx5Jluafg__thumb/img/sLG2l7rGmzIon5ZScZ5YAxS_mjQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5507191.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Timer","Deck Construction","Real-Time","Simultaneous Action Selection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.92581,"averageRating":6.47538,"rank":3234,"designers":["Travis P Jones"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games","999 Games","Albi","Albi Polska","CrowD Games","Delta Vision Publishing","Feuerland Spiele","Ghenos Games","Maldito Games","Matagot"],"artists":["Robert Leask"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":18,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":8,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
