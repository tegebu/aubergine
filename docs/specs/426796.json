{"gameId":426796,"name":"Stamp Swap","description":"Designer Paul Salomon (Honey Buzz, Genotype) brings stamp collecting to life on tabletops in Stamp Swap! Draft from a public pool of face-down and face-up tiles (along with some bonus cards), then simultaneously divide them into 2 groups. You will select one group from another player and keep the group of yours that isn't selected. Organize your growing collection each round and score 1 of 4 goals--choose wisely, as you can't score that goal again.&#10;&#10;The art of stamp collecting is not just in accumulating many stamps, but in collecting high-quality stamps (including rare gold-foil stamps). This 3-round game for 1-5 players is your chance to meet other attendees, put together a beautiful and well-focused stamp collection, and show it off in a series of contests. Do well and you may walk away with the top prize at this year&rsquo;s Stamp Swap!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tf2ryUBtxnnUCGROOy4QHg__original/img/gMkZg4DPr5dZ6Fu9W05PPNQQRww=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8365415.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Tf2ryUBtxnnUCGROOy4QHg__thumb/img/jIbqpvx2URBkJgr7Y1OjKB_pwqs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8365415.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["I Cut, You Choose","Open Drafting","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.58333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Paul Salomon"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games","Feuerland Spiele"],"artists":["Conner Gillette"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
