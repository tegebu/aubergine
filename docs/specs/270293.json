{"gameId":270293,"name":"Gorinto","description":"Elements gather energy in unique patterns, challenging you with finding the ideal route to balance and harmony. Earth digs deep, Water flows wide, Fire rises high, Wind blows freely, and Void slips between the rest. Can you gain the understanding you need to uncover true elemental wisdom?&#10;&#10;A Gorinto is a type of Japanese pagoda of the five elements: earth (cube), water (sphere), fire (pyramid), air (crescent), and void (lotus). It often housed the relic of a Buddha or saint, and together represent the realm of perfect understanding.&#10;&#10;In Gorinto, players take turns selecting element tiles from the Path (perimeter) and moving them onto the Mountain (game board). Each element collects in a unique pattern. The elements collected each turn will allow you to collect more elements over the turns and rounds.&#10;&#10;Points are scored at the end of each round based on goals selected at the start of the game, as well as the elements chosen at the end of the game. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Will you achieve perfect understanding?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PmNzEXa5jlsrzNL4l-X8-g__original/img/_c-Sy5HUwoKNJkWf3fdM2Hy4s8o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4943733.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PmNzEXa5jlsrzNL4l-X8-g__thumb/img/pClbt6-RN-boUh6Ptot4sCN15fQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4943733.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Pattern Recognition","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.94053,"averageRating":7.39082,"rank":2943,"designers":["Richard Yaner"],"publishers":["Grand Gamers Guild","Happy meeple games","Maldito Games","Super Meeple"],"artists":["Josh Cappel"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
