{"gameId":319910,"name":"Pagan: Fate of Roanoke","description":"Pagan: Fate of Roanoke is an expandable deduction card game set in the colonial America of 1587.&#10;&#10;The essence of this asymmetrical game is a witch's struggle against a witch hunter. As the witch strives to complete a ritual of renaturation, the hunter tries to discover her true identity among nine villagers. Each turn, the two players use their action pawns on active villagers to draw cards, play cards, and gain influence. Each player has their own variable card deck of fifty cards; with these cards, the witch can brew powerful potions, improve their familiar, and cast enchantments and charms, while the witch hunter enlists allies, claim strategic locations, and ruthlessly investigates the villagers.&#10;&#10;As the witch, your objective is to collect enough secrets to perform a ritual so potent that the entire region will fall under your spell and Mother Nature will reclaim the island. As the hunter, you gather all the allies and support you can muster to bring the witch to justice before her fatal ritual comes to fruition.&#10;&#10;The prototype won the Danish design award Otto at the Fastaval for best game of show in 2018.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UReUHUg3rKE0JkB2InwMfg__original/img/7I1HFbjX1Rd2ns8Sh9QGRQF22ys=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8063277.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UReUHUg3rKE0JkB2InwMfg__thumb/img/9Z9FwM-6os_4D7eC2oBfKlK5rUc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8063277.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Deck Construction","Deduction","Hand Management","Turn Order: Claim Action","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.74971,"averageRating":8.06454,"rank":783,"designers":["Kasper Kjær Christiansen","Kåre Storgaard"],"publishers":["Wyrmgold GmbH","Capstone Games","Games7Days","Lucky Duck Games","Maldito Games","REXhry","Super Meeple"],"artists":["Maren Gutt"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":34,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":38,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":35,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
