{"gameId":347521,"name":"Blitzkrieg!: World War Two in 20 Minutes","description":"New Square Edition: Now includes Nippon expansion, updated Axis bag art, and an updated rulebook!&#10;&#10;Recreate World War Two in 20 minutes! The perfect wargame for non-wargamers, Blitzkrieg! allows two players to battle across the War&rsquo;s most iconic theatres, winning key campaigns and building military might.&#10;&#10;Players draw army tokens from a bag to determine their starting forces and to replenish their losses. Rather than &lsquo;fighting&rsquo; battles with dice or cards, players allocate their military resources to each theatre&rsquo;s campaigns, winning victory points, further resources, special weapons, and strategic advantages as they play. Refight World War Two several times in one evening!&#10;&#10;Includes Solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi.&#10;&#10;Rules changes include:&#10;- Score bonus VPs from war track once when closing theatre due to reaching end of war track&#10;- Can only move token to end of war track in theatre where token placed, not on other tokens (i.e. Strategic Advantage or Nuclear Weapon)&#10;- When closing a theatre by reaching the end of a battle track, you receive the bonus VPs on the battle track once.&#10;- Only the theatre you placed a token in can be closed by reaching the end of the battle track. If the effect of a battle space (Strategic Advantage) or token (Nuclear Weapon) would cause the marker of a different theatre to reach the end of the battle track, it instead stops at the penultimate space.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8Uxw0IhS_MGMS_02G_KnuQ__original/img/Jc6kdu2I4Q97V8H-P9Fxaz9DEiM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6156946.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8Uxw0IhS_MGMS_02G_KnuQ__thumb/img/wQLEH6i0YjD0JXG86W3VQXTFHmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6156946.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Kill Steal","Race","Solo / Solitaire Game","Take That","Tug of War"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.67198,"averageRating":7.80008,"rank":-1,"designers":["Paolo Mori"],"publishers":["PSC Games"],"artists":["Alan D'Amico","Paolo Mori","Paul Sizer"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":6,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
