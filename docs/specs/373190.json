{"gameId":373190,"name":"Maps of Misterra","description":"In Maps of Misterra, you play as explorers have discovered a mystical and unknown island. Your goal: Explore the island and complete your personal and hidden objectives while proposing a correct cartography of the island to earn maximum points.&#10;&#10;To set up, place a central board representing the island on the table, and give each player a personal map they will use to transcribe their discoveries. Each turn, players choose two actions among these:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move their explorer pawn on the central board.&#10;     Discover new terrains close to your explorer pawn, choosing from four randomly drawn tiles.&#10;     Claim control of areas.&#10;&#10;&#10;A type of terrain on the central island must be explored twice before being validated. Thus, the unvalidated terrain types can change &mdash; &quot;You thought you saw grass? You were mistaken.&quot; &mdash; and then your personal map will no longer match the central board.&#10;&#10;You have to find the ideal balance between your personal objectives, and a correct cartography of the island.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/79aNnqP7kcnAE8ATvlq9Iw__original/img/JFtX5fWQhljxfuIPg42aDMcCPrI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7277291.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/79aNnqP7kcnAE8ATvlq9Iw__thumb/img/qMrgMBMtpOG1-UW_tikNt9gEO4k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7277291.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Grid Coverage","Matching","Open Drafting","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.6316,"averageRating":6.51668,"rank":7575,"designers":["Mathieu Bossu","Thomas Cariate","Timoth√©e Decroix"],"publishers":["Sit Down!"],"artists":["Stanislas Puech"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
