{"gameId":363273,"name":"Copan: Dying City","description":"Welcome to the city of Copan, shining jewel of the Maya civilization. The city is flourishing, and as one of its ruling families, this golden age holds many opportunities for you to increase your influence and wealth. But Copan is destined to fall. Dark times lie ahead, and as you work to secure your legacy over generations, you have to face the city's slow decline. Your progress will hindered by dwindling resources, crumbling political structure, natural disasters, and war.&#10;&#10;Will your family become a part of the history of Copan, forever carved into the steps of the hieroglyphic stair? Or will your story be forgotten?&#10;&#10;Copan: Dying City is a heavy Eurogame for 1 to 4 players with both worker-placement and tile-placement mechanisms. The game features a reversed difficulty curve because when play begins, resources are plentiful, making most actions easy to accomplish. However, all resources are finite. When they reach critical levels, they trigger potentially devastating events, and once they run out, they're gone forever.&nbsp;Every move you make impacts the rest of the game, both for you and other players, as Copan's inevitable fate looms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9y6O1VWujfF-pLPkdd_H_Q__original/img/aqIZ7dSOj2XroUi4nqn0pT3zDfQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6873172.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9y6O1VWujfF-pLPkdd_H_Q__thumb/img/9r_hBN3LXVdq0rVc_kXXCwH7iXY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6873172.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.52731,"averageRating":7.11176,"rank":14300,"designers":["Eric Dubus","Olivier Melison"],"publishers":["Holy Grail Games"],"artists":["Ronan Toulhoat"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
