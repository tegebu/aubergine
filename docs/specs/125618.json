{"gameId":125618,"name":"Libertalia","description":"Captain Swallow has always dreamed of pocketing a large nest egg in order to retire on a remote island &ndash; but he never counted on stiff competition from Captains Stanley Rackum, Dirk Chivers and others, greedy and cruel enemies who always manage to attack the same ships as him. If he wants to finally sink back and enjoy peaceful days in the sun, he must become the most cunning pirate!&#10;&#10;In Libertalia, you must thwart the plans of competitive pirates over the course of three rounds while using cards that show the same crew members as your piratical comrades-in-arms. Yes, not only do they attack the same ships, but they employ the same type of ravenous scum that you do! Can you take advantage of the powers of your characters at the right time? Will you be outdone by a pirate smarter than you? Jump into the water and prove your tactical skills!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LeUx57CGYdnIEsnGebOB0A__original/img/ZMdpuswDvVy-I97-ws45isBIRO4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1326136.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LeUx57CGYdnIEsnGebOB0A__thumb/img/BRF-D_TW7oHr7t6Yh0F9wx_zFI4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1326136.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Hand Management","Selection Order Bid","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection","Take That","Turn Order: Role Order","Variable Phase Order"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2012,"bggRating":6.94472,"averageRating":7.15143,"rank":461,"designers":["Paolo Mori"],"publishers":["Marabunta","Asmodee","Asterion Press"],"artists":["Ben Carre","St√©phane Gantiez"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":105,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":8,"recommended":43,"notRecommended":110,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":28,"recommended":113,"notRecommended":21,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":102,"recommended":77,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":76,"recommended":87,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":51,"recommended":86,"notRecommended":30,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":77,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
