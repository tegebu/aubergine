{"gameId":282524,"name":"Horrified","description":"The stakes have been raised. Imagine living in a place so wretched that it's not plagued by one, two, or even three monsters &mdash; but seven of the most horrifying fiends!&#10;&#10;In this game, you'll come face to face with them all as you work together to rid the town of the maniacal or misunderstood creatures&hellip;before it's too late.&#10;&#10;Horrified includes high-quality sculpted miniatures (Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, Dracula, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon). Its innovative, easy-to-learn, cooperative gameplay has players working together against the monsters with varying levels of difficulty. Just as each monster is unique, they require different strategies and tactics to be defeated.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoClIcwjDo_iZs0idVikDw__original/img/oGKxUavbTR49i-P6O-WUyBfuRYs=/0x0/pic4848330.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoClIcwjDo_iZs0idVikDw__thumb/img/YSf5Z99aBqAlNKaGBj_oGb1oKH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4848330.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Pick-up and Deliver","Point to Point Movement","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers","Variable Setup"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":7.26088,"averageRating":7.84454,"rank":199,"designers":["Prospero Hall"],"publishers":["Ravensburger"],"artists":["Prospero Hall"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":5,"recommended":46,"notRecommended":17,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":22,"recommended":46,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":54,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":21,"recommended":40,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":5,"recommended":28,"notRecommended":20,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":37,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
