{"gameId":400949,"name":"Dark Tomb: Bloodthorn Island","description":"Dark Tomb - Bloodthorn Island is the next adventure in the Dark Tomb series. It's an ultra-portable tabletop dungeon crawler in which a group of uniquely skilled characters must navigate to Bloodthorn Island and defeat the evil land serpent Lorgon.&#10;&#10;Characters are fully interchangeable with Dark Tomb - Crypts of Aurelian, and work collaboratively though three stages collecting items, battling monsters, and exploring tiles. On each turn characters can choose from a variety of attacks, movement, or other abilities in addition to utilizing items encountered.&#10;&#10;If the party fully explores a stage and defeats all monsters they conquer it and move on to the next. If they fail in their quest, they can recoup and try again. Map tiles, monsters, and items are randomized, so every play-though is unique.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CQYuQRkPxpdGSAOadoJ15w__original/img/FhHBoylZNWYxbmLRd0PLfGbZ5DE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7723971.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CQYuQRkPxpdGSAOadoJ15w__thumb/img/GAP_0zWMUd__AMtODK4eD1ChJN8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7723971.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":50,"mechanics":[],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Andy Bergmann"],"publishers":["Kozz Games"],"artists":["Andy Bergmann","Daniel Rubio"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
