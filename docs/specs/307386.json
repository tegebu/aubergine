{"gameId":307386,"name":"Set a Watch: Swords of the Coin","description":"The Kingdom is in grave danger once again, but our mighty adventurers are nowhere to be found. The King has stepped in and offered to pay any mercenary for taking up arms against the darkness. This quest falls on the shoulders of four mercenaries, each with a unique set of skills, to band together to vanquish this evil from the Kingdom.&#10;&#10;Set a Watch: Swords of the Coin is both a standalone game for 1-4 players and an expansion that can be combined with the original cooperative game. Featuring all new characters, this bunch of adventurers has to be motivated to work together. Every round you will visit all new locations and pick an adventurer to rest and get paid to take camp actions. You can use this coin to purchase powerful items from the new Merchant board and item deck.  These items will assist the  rest of the party on watch as they battle a line of all new creatures trying to make their way into camp. It is still a battle to keep the campfire burning! Use your wits and skill to fight for the light&hellip;or all will perish in the darkness.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/iwvvE6k_1pDwUYzBHhrkVOCVaqs=/0x0/pic5354512.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/w498Ni8-Cp2fQwfZtooMm-MdOnI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5354512.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":75,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Pattern Recognition","Role Playing","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Todd Walsh"],"publishers":["Rock Manor Games"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
