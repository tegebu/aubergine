Build the map as you play, with untamed forests, pristine lakes, harsh mountains, and a sprawling network of roads connecting fledgling towns.  Earn actions with your map placements depending on the features of each tile you choose to add.&#10;&#10;Blood of the Northmen is the latest game by Carl Chudyk (Glory To Rome, Innovation, Impulse) taking players north of Europe into the wild Nordic lands of the 9th century.
