{"gameId":361235,"name":"Compile","description":"Compile is a mathematical trick-taking card game for two players, based on Cassino. The deck includes cards numbered 1-15  in 4 suits, or 60 cards in total.&#10;&#10;In setup, 4 cards are dealt to each player and 4 face up to the centre. Players take turns putting down one card from their hand and are trying to take as many other cards from the centre as they can. Aces are worth one point each, and two lucky cards are worth three points if captured - 3 of triangles, and 10 of lozenges. Build (compile) piles of cards up over the round, but beware - the other player may be able to capture your pile!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EuhfQy2EXwT2Eyl8VsBiDQ__original/img/o0PoA3ljUME9MIXSxJjSH0Xyi2U=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6882444.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EuhfQy2EXwT2Eyl8VsBiDQ__thumb/img/0CPqrbZtEGOG5PwKGNc6PWQ5WJg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6882444.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Push Your Luck","Trick-taking"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Rhiannon McKinstry"],"publishers":["MKE Games"],"artists":["Rhiannon McKinstry"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
