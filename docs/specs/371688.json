{"gameId":371688,"name":"HUANG","description":"The period of the Warring States (475-221 BCE) describes a time of endless wars between seven rival states: Qin, Chu, Qi, Yan, Han, Wei, and Zhao. These states were finally unified in 221 BCE&nbsp;under the Qin dynasty to lay the origin of today's China, with its two main rivers: the Yellow and the Yangtze.&#10;&#10;HUANG, first released as Yellow &amp; Yangtze, the sister game to the highly acclaimed board game Tigris &amp; Euphrates, invites you to replay this eventful period and to lead your dynasty to victory.&#10;&#10;In HUANG, players build civilizations through tile placement. Players are given five different leaders: Governor, Soldier, Farmer, Trader, and Artisan. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category. Conflicts arise when civilizations connect on the board. To succeed, players' civilizations must survive these conflicts, calm peasant revolts, and grow secure enough to build prestigious pagodas.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xLKOIcS7uozAP1DiIIw_Tw__original/img/WRPtDmzaz6dcyBTunOvFgafy0IA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7353926.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xLKOIcS7uozAP1DiIIw_Tw__thumb/img/6BtWi889aE9q58FfVTvx1zlbcpU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7353926.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Hidden Victory Points","Highest-Lowest Scoring","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.87222,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["PHALANX"],"artists":["Bartek JÄ™drzejewski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
