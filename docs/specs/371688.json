{"gameId":371688,"name":"HUANG","description":"Lead an ancient China kingdom dreaming of imperial power, establish new states, build pagodas, strive for influence &ndash; and battle to unite the country under your glorious dynasty! HUANG is set in the Warring States period (475-221 BC), a time of endless wars between seven rival states: Qin, Chu, Qi, Yan, Han, Wei, and Zhao.&#10;&#10;HUANG is a 2 to 4 player game set in ancient China, during the time of the Warring States. You take control of one of the Warring States, battling to unite the country under your dynasty. Each player has five different leaders: Governor, Soldier, Farmer, Trader, and Artisan.&#10;&#10;Clever placement of these leaders and their corresponding tiles on the board is key, allowing you to build pagodas to score points, trigger or avoid wars, and instigate peasant revolts that bring down your enemies. Play is fast and addictive, lasting around 90 minutes, with a very short teaching time reflecting the elegance of the ruleset.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xLKOIcS7uozAP1DiIIw_Tw__original/img/WRPtDmzaz6dcyBTunOvFgafy0IA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7353926.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xLKOIcS7uozAP1DiIIw_Tw__thumb/img/6BtWi889aE9q58FfVTvx1zlbcpU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7353926.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Hidden Victory Points","Highest-Lowest Scoring","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":6.08378,"averageRating":7.99823,"rank":2581,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["PHALANX"],"artists":["Bartek JÄ™drzejewski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":15,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
