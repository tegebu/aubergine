{"gameId":315610,"name":"Massive Darkness 2: Hellscape","description":"Ten years have passed since the Lightbringers drove back the hordes of the Darkness and sealed the Portal from whence they came. The heroes thought their job done, but the newfound peace was never meant to last. Dangerous new Portals have suddenly opened up all across the land. The Darkness and its hordes are flooding through, stronger than ever. It will not be enough to simply close the Portals this time. The Lightbringers must travel through them into the unknown to destroy the Darkness once and for all. Either Light will triumph, or the Darkness will consume every being in the world. This is where players find themselves in Massive Darkness 2, a new edition of the hit dungeon-crawler game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e-QmT0KuEc0E4bWNih6EVQ__original/img/alQDRawS3Soxpe-sCU3_WBNUCNk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6107854.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e-QmT0KuEc0E4bWNih6EVQ__thumb/img/Q1WD-ufxyF37HxWH5T6t8amKcqk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6107854.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.952,"averageRating":8.04097,"rank":534,"designers":["Alex Olteanu","Marco Portugal"],"publishers":["CMON Global Limited","Guillotine Games","BoardM Factory","Delta Vision Publishing","Galápagos Jogos","Geekach Games","Hobby World","Portal Games","REXhry"],"artists":["Édouard Guiton"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":21,"recommended":42,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":33,"recommended":41,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":50,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":17,"recommended":36,"notRecommended":17,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":46,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":54,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":48,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
