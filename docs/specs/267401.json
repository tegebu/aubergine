{"gameId":267401,"name":"Lawyer Up","description":"In Lawyer Up, a two-player asymmetrical card game, players take on the roles of attorneys facing off against each other in a courtroom case. One player takes on the role of the prosecution and the other takes on the role of defense. Each case has its own unique mechanisms and story from Murder to Racketeering.&#10;&#10;Lawyer Up is a game of arguments, influence and strategies.  Players start with Discovery, where they will go through all the evidence of the case and draft what they think is important for them to win.  Then Players will take turns calling and questioning witnesses - building arguments by chaining together cards with the same symbols and earning influence.  Attorneys then spend their influence to sway the biases of the jury to their side of the argument.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Lr4bMrGPY2pAY1CoZDg8tQ__original/img/Tn8gk761selP14fxTOiQGOXLWOg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5196611.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Lr4bMrGPY2pAY1CoZDg8tQ__thumb/img/KkSbw4VnYc5zC3-LNLsnXQSZv-w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5196611.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":75,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Card Drafting","Pattern Building","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.8253,"averageRating":7.3359,"rank":3512,"designers":["Samuel Bailey","Mike Gnade"],"publishers":["Rock Manor Games","Boom Boom Games","Giant Roc","Giochix.it","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Treetato Studio"],"artists":["Vincent Christiaens","Joel Finch","Matt Zeilinger"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":8,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
