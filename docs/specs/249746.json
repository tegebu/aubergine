The events in the game are tied to real and fictional characters and places in Victorian London The same London which inspired so many stories&hellip;&#10;&#10;The action takes place on the city map, with players placing their agents and buildings on the board through card play. Every card is unique. The cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters who have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player draws a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you can never be sure what the other players need to do in order to win. You need to fulfill your goal while also trying to prevent others from winning!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QVnxAPBc7rhzQ90WGH-G_Q__original/img/cH6iypKk34JkDjEHGj6laKJ-GeI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6111342.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QVnxAPBc7rhzQ90WGH-G_Q__thumb/img/rB0pRXnEr4Kw6EUUOZH35f5uUiI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6111342.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Dice Rolling","Events","Hand Management","Hidden Roles","Interrupts","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Take That"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":6.40056,"averageRating":7.46876,"rank":1489,"designers":["Martin Wallace"],"publishers":["PHALANX","ASYNCRON games","Choo Choo Games","Ediciones MasQueOca","Nova Era (Нова Ера)"],"artists":["Bartek Jędrzejewski","Grzegorz Ryszko","Jakub Skop","Miłosz Wojtasik"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":28,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":32,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":33,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
