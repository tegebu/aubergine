{"gameId":381297,"name":"Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze","description":"Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze, which is themed around the pulp adventures, tall tales, and local legends of the mid-20th century, gives you a whole new way to play Unmatched.&#10;&#10;In the game, players work together to defeat one of two villains: Mothman or the Martian Invader. Each villain has a unique battlefield with unique objectives. If the villain completes their objective (or defeats the heroes), the players lose. The villains are aided by a number of possible minions: Jersey Devil, Ant Queen, Loveland Frog, The Blob, Tarantula, and Skunk Ape. The enemies use special action cards and a simple targeting scheme to control their movement and attacks.&#10;&#10;The set comes with four new heroes: Nikola Tesla discharges his electrified coils to power up his effects; Annie Christmas gets stronger when she's fighting from behind; The Golden Bat, the world's first superhero, has a variety of powerful effects; and Dr. Jill Trent, Science Sleuth, calls on a collection of gizmos.&#10;&#10;Keeping to the Unmatched brand, you may use heroes from other Unmatched sets in Unmatched Adventures, and you can use the included heroes and battlefields to play competitive Unmatched.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pDiHT-n1xpW71Ck_wiR8_g__original/img/pho_viNg1Jk28LoXbMkTTvVHOIw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7375477.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pDiHT-n1xpW71Ck_wiR8_g__thumb/img/OZ4P9ZIWCKAlisyIas_rsyj6hiI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7375477.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Cooperative Game","Hand Management","Line of Sight","Multi-Use Cards","Point to Point Movement","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.06283,"averageRating":8.40844,"rank":2527,"designers":["Jason Hager","Darren Reckner"],"publishers":["Restoration Games","Albi","GaGa Games","Geekach Games","IELLO","Ogry Games","Reflexshop","TCG Factory"],"artists":["JJ Ariosa","Anne Benjamin","Marie Bergeron","Ashley Flor√©al","Satoshi Kamanaka","Nastya Lehn","Kwanchai Moriya","Ian Reed (I)","Jason Taylor"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":6,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":6,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
