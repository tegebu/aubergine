{"gameId":360206,"name":"Discordia","description":"The first cities on the Rhine emerged from Roman outposts protecting the border with Germania. As the governor of one of these cities, your task is to develop it in the best possible way, while also defending it against the Germanic tribes. Empress Agrippina and her son Nero will inspect your actions and honor the most successful governor.&#10;&#10;In 'Discordia', you develop your city by building farms, barracks, defenses, harbors, and markets, and by trading with ships. Use your seamen, soldiers, merchants, and farmers profitably, fulfill decrees, and secure privileges &mdash; acting carefully at all times so that your city grows neither too fast nor too slow. Will you have the best-developed city at the end of the fourth year, or will you manage to impress the empress before then and win the game early?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VkCBFlvAAHvaUk84H9usDg__original/img/-JE6a6OIHZeU8doazKlzudEI3uk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6797734.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VkCBFlvAAHvaUk84H9usDg__thumb/img/9Q9MA7yu6uHVmKiiBZo_qlGy8Ac=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6797734.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Dice Rolling","Income","Sudden Death Ending","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.61427,"averageRating":7.39133,"rank":7195,"designers":["Bernd Eisenstein"],"publishers":["Irongames"],"artists":["Lukas Siegmon"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
