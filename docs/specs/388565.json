{"gameId":388565,"name":"War Chest: Nightfall","description":"Not all battles are won by grand armies on large fields or in defensible castles. In some cases more subtle and perhaps deadly tactics are used. From fake letters and treaties, feigned retreats or advances, poisoned water supplies, assassinations and infiltration, many things can happen in the dark to throw an enemy into disarray before the main battle ever starts.&#10;&#10;In War Chest: Nightfall you will have the opportunity to use specialized units to hamper and hinder your opponent&rsquo;s attempts to effectively mobilize their forces. Mastering the art of subterfuge will be key to success with this new and exciting expansion for the classic War Chest strategy and tactics game!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/47svrIp_8WxJAMeyAvn6hA__original/img/Mey-_NmgPc4N1zyTgufxd6eroDo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7522071.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/47svrIp_8WxJAMeyAvn6hA__thumb/img/WezQAGniiRqvyJQdSoBvyDhaw4E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7522071.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":10,"rank":-1,"designers":["Trevor Benjamin","David Thompson (I)"],"publishers":["Alderac Entertainment Group"],"artists":["Brigette Indelicato"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
