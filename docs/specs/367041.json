{"gameId":367041,"name":"Scholars of the South Tigris","description":"Scholars of the South Tigris is set during the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, circa 830 AD. The Caliph has called upon the keenest minds to acquire scientific manuscripts from all over the known world. Players will need to increase their influence in the House of Wisdom, and hire skilled linguists to translate the foreign scrolls into Arabic. In this Golden Age of wisdom and knowledge, be mindful not to neglect one in pursuit of the other.&#10;&#10;The aim of Scholars of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game&rsquo;s end. Points are gained by translating scrolls, increasing knowledge in various areas of science and mathematics, influencing the 3 guilds, and by retiring translators after their years of faithful service. The game end is triggered once all 4 caliph cards have been revealed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z_paoUYMDZ__bnm_Boq8AA__original/img/cr0IWHice36TsraMMEzJkxrd048=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6966624.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z_paoUYMDZ__bnm_Boq8AA__thumb/img/ZSU5aPJtWryE5EJdUB88yXkEVP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6966624.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.07088,"averageRating":8.17803,"rank":2496,"designers":["S J Macdonald","Shem Phillips"],"publishers":["Garphill Games","Fever Games","Mosaico Jogos","Pixie Games","Schwerkraft-Verlag"],"artists":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":7,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":14,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
