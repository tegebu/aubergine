{"gameId":312959,"name":"Rallyman: DIRT","description":"Rallyman: DIRT is a brand new edition of the classic rally game by Jean-Christophe Bouvier.&#10;&#10;Get behind the wheel of a supercharged rally car, and race against the clock to get the best time around the different stages of a course!&#10;&#10;Rallyman: DIRT is a roll and move racing game, so to move around the track, you&rsquo;ll be rolling dice! Each player will have a mixture of Gear, Brake and Coast dice at their disposal to get their car speeding along the track. Each die can only be rolled once per turn. Each die has a certain number of Warning symbols. If you get 3 in one roll, you&rsquo;ll lose control of your car, increasing your time and potentially damaging your vehicle!&#10;&#10;Rallyman: DIRT is all about you and the track &ndash; planning the perfect trajectory is the key to success! You&rsquo;ll have to adjust your driving technique to tackle the challenges of each stage, from sharp corners to open water, obstacles and bumps.&#10;&#10;This new edition combines the original Rallyman from 2009 with its expansion: Dirt. It features gorgeous new artwork and upgraded components, while including classic mechanics from the original game such as drifting, jumping, and cutting corners. On top of its new visual design, it replaces the large rectangular map sections of the first edition with hexagonal tiles that allow players to recreate iconic tracks, or whip up their own unique designs in a flash.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pxdk-6R-_uAcUyRx6J2k7A__original/img/nTzE3m02HZzs-wH_K9EobqZEx0A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7969555.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pxdk-6R-_uAcUyRx6J2k7A__thumb/img/4-QcelhBCqXywkgfAsaVjogGb34=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7969555.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Different Dice Movement","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Push Your Luck","Race","Roll / Spin and Move","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.08538,"averageRating":7.46954,"rank":2634,"designers":["Jean-Christophe Bouvier"],"publishers":["Holy Grail Games","Czacha Games","Devir","Elznir Games","Raven Distribution","Synapses Games"],"artists":["Joëlle Drans","Loïc Muzy"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":16,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":18,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":18,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":8,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":3,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":4,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":18,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
