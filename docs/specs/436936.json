{"gameId":436936,"name":"No Loose Ends","description":"Crime pays if you&rsquo;re careful. Still, a bank heist is no easy job. The precious loot is heavily guarded, and each thing you steal leaves a trail of evidence behind. Risk leads to reward if you can cover up the evidence and leave no loose end untied.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;No Loose Ends is a trick-taking game in which players use cards from their hand to bid, carefully planning their heist. Winning tricks with the right suit or number will cover up the evidence in your bid and earn you points. Uncovered evidence and extra tricks not according to plan will lose you points for leaving loose ends from the robbery. Will you pull off the perfect crime or snitch on your fellow thieves?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n-kaK1nLMpck7tn0tBMVaw__original/img/3xjOkbFpy-Uor6HtVo-FoPXLLMk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8708203.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n-kaK1nLMpck7tn0tBMVaw__thumb/img/PeSH9G3OCay_OxZWHRVXbwUxbFg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8708203.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Predictive Bid","Trick-taking"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.48438,"rank":-1,"designers":["新澤 大樹 (Taiki Shinzawa)"],"publishers":["GameHead"],"artists":["別府さい (Sai Beppu)"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
