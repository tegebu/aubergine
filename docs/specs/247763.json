{"gameId":247763,"name":"Underwater Cities","description":"In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible.&#10;&#10;The main principle of the game is card placement. Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.&#10;&#10;All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__original/img/1WL5-4DZi0hX76HEgsLIYRRaIh4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4837710.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__thumb/img/1gGYiRBx7W4wyLy826EHGTdjsKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4837710.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Income","Network and Route Building","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Stat-Based","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":7.75447,"averageRating":8.1155,"rank":42,"designers":["Vladimír Suchý"],"publishers":["Delicious Games","Arrakis Games","Atalia","Gém Klub Kft.","Hobby World","MeepleBR","MINDOK","MS Edizioni","MYBG Co., Ltd.","Pegasus Spiele","Portal Games","Rio Grande Games","sternenschimmermeer","数寄ゲームズ (Suki Games)"],"artists":["Uildrim","Milan Vavroň"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":29,"recommended":135,"notRecommended":54,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":225,"recommended":93,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":115,"recommended":153,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":21,"recommended":94,"notRecommended":156,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":127,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
