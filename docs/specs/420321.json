{"gameId":420321,"name":"The White Castle: Matcha","description":"The tea ceremony lies at the heart of Japanese culture, giving life the most essential and elemental concepts of hospitality, respect, and Zen philosophy. There, they believe that tea, which came from China in the 13th century, resolved the health problems of the Buddhist monks who drank it. Over the years, the tea ceremony evolved to offer the samurai a place of calm, far from the chaos of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;In The White Castle: Matcha, you will have to deal with a new place in which to influence the court using new members of your clan. Having members of your clan in good seats within the Chashitsu (tea room) will help you achieve a greater level of influence within the court of Himeji. Also, you will have one additional action each round. Will that be enough?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xPO9VCD5-KeLzukaWVTzGw__original/img/7rW0aqO1lkhBCrrQUM9XSkKQSbI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8179939.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xPO9VCD5-KeLzukaWVTzGw__thumb/img/doB5UVNXWs5oKyKju_URNLFSMoY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8179939.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":110,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Dice Rolling","Multi-Use Cards","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.1375,"rank":-1,"designers":["Isra C.","Shei S."],"publishers":["Devir","IELLO","Reflexshop"],"artists":["Joan Guardiet"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
