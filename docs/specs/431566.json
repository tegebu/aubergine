{"gameId":431566,"name":"Chronicles of Civilization","description":"Chronicles of Civilization is a complex civilization game in a simple PnP format. The primary goal was to capture the feel of a digital civilization game in a board game format &ndash; and in practice, it resembles a blend of 'Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall' or 'Knight' with a computer civilization game.&#10;&#10;Players stand at the head of our civilization and develop various domains: food production, mining, navigation, religion, science, diplomacy, finances, and production. A large portion of the game takes place on a map where you move settlers to build settlements, farms, mines, and ports, all of which must be connected by a network of roads to your capital. It is crucial to acquire resources for expansion; for instance, you send workers to fell trees or extract raw materials. These elements are intricately interwoven by a dense web of dependencies. Additionally, you must constantly manage the population's happiness and military development.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is driven by a chronicle card that serves as the scenario (and, like the map, is interchangeable, ensuring enormous replayability). In each session, there are various conditions for victory and defeat.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QQHX3Q_4hjHHS9twZ6sb4A__original/img/Ne-uqymr93_2x4cYSFA3CMwMRLk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8792304.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QQHX3Q_4hjHHS9twZ6sb4A__thumb/img/vPknRpVdacOXb3S_QjdcWsHWiWU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8792304.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":3,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Paper-and-Pencil","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.25,"rank":-1,"designers":["Radosław Ignatów"],"publishers":["(Web published)"],"artists":["Michał Teliga"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
