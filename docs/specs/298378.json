To do so, they are assisted by several characters with different abilities. Every year, the Maharaja, the great king of India, will change his residence and players will receive rewards according to their Gods' worship value. At the beginning of each year, players plan their actions in a secret phase to be played simultaneously.&#10;&#10;At the end of the seventh year or when a player builds their seventh statue, the game ends, then the player with most prestige wins.&#10;&#10;Aside from the new graphics and components and from players now building statues instead of palaces, this new edition of Maharaja includes new characters to use during the turn that change turn order, additional ways to earn victory points, an additional bonus each time you score a city after the Maharaja's visit depending on the assistant you chose, and additional modular rules that can be added during the game and in the final scoring.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Includes solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi &amp; Simone Luciani&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ukXJS_Zl13uWhnJ0licdlw__original/img/H7pNNvCrUjNINjy-a6qsY99R04k=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5415555.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ukXJS_Zl13uWhnJ0licdlw__thumb/img/MOKKVjFo9TzTPh6NlicZSLaQb2A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5415555.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Point to Point Movement","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.69015,"averageRating":6.92018,"rank":5056,"designers":["Michael Kiesling","Wolfgang Kramer"],"publishers":["Cranio Creations","Gal√°pagos Jogos","Intrafin Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Maldito Games"],"artists":["Klemens Franz","Samuele Gaudio"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":4,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
