His elvish helpers are busy making sure he's ready to deliver joy across the world! The elves have a lot to do: toys to be built and assembled, reindeer to be tended in the stables, and the North Pole's own Christmas tree to decorate. It's a time of unbelievable hustle and bustle!&#10;&#10;After the Christmas season is over, Santa always takes his own holiday, somewhere sunny and warm, and he brings along the most industrious team of elves as a reward. Can you lead your elvish crew to earn a spot with Santa on vacation?&#10;&#10;Santa's Workshop is a reimplementation of a game by the same name released in 2017.
