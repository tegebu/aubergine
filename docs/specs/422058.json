It's engine building game in which your goal is to build the best possible ecosystem in which the population of fish and other creatures will thrive, and which will attract new species.&#10;A central concern for you in managing Atoll is a variable called fatigue - whenever you use a special coral ability or increase the population of one of your cards, that card becomes fatigued. However, some cards allow you to remove fatigue from other cards and others allow you to increase population without fatigue, and finding these options can be the way to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/f3gbTt132HGMryAPhiPwmw__original/img/qd2gpa49rn_OR2NYk3_ADdKazD4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8243847.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/f3gbTt132HGMryAPhiPwmw__thumb/img/xNOZebgc92t9BseFkzRbZo-iEgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8243847.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Chaining","Connections","End Game Bonuses","Set Collection","Square Grid","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.09091,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jan Štěpánek"],"publishers":["Albi"],"artists":["Martina Lásková","Michal Peichl"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
