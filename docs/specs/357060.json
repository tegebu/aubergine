{"gameId":357060,"name":"Maglev Metro: Moonbases & Mars","description":"Two brand new space-based recessed expansion maps for Maglev Metro that tweak the mechanics and how the game is played, giving the base game even more replayability.&#10;&#10;Magnetic Levitation technology is the technology of choice for extra-terrestrial transportation, and your job is to build a network of maglev rails to assist in creating a lunar vacation destination, taking advantage of its 1/6th gravity and relatively flat surface.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Create your own personal moonbase where passengers arrive from Earth (even if your train is elsewhere)&#10;     Move four times as far (up to 16 stations when the action is maxed out) for no extra cost&#10;     Create a dual-color station in the middle of the map that can accept two different passenger types&#10;     Use new Brake and Reverse technology to make speeding around the map faster and more efficient&#10;     Build track to connect to your opponents' moonbases in order to pick up their passengers.&#10;&#10;&#10;Mars' colonization has begun, and now it's time to connect locations with maglev railways.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Zip around the planet by building track all the way around it (instantly going from one side of the map to the other)&#10;     Use the new Launch action to send your train up above the atmosphere and deliver passengers to both Phobos and Deimos&#10;     No need for reverse on Mars, as your train moves backwards and forwards&#10;     Canyons are expensive to build on but provide access to critical stations, including the central launch station&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nfhHJeRyRl3znXYPQtjpEg__original/img/QtCXyvWk6myYu8hWkVJYavy1AQ8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6689643.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nfhHJeRyRl3znXYPQtjpEg__thumb/img/6KYQHHwfoFbX7mQYFE0FgEfITyU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6689643.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Network and Route Building"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ted Alspach"],"publishers":["BÃ©zier Games"],"artists":["Alanna Kelsey"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
