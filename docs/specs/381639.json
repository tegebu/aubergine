{"gameId":381639,"name":"Score Cards","description":"Score Cards is a two-player abstract &quot;play-one-draw-one&quot; card game with one simple goal: score! Each turn you&rsquo;ll play a card from your hand, score it, then draw a new card to replace it. Every card has a unique scoring condition that will score differently based on the cards you have already played--as well as those your opponent has played. Map out your strategy to maximize your scoring, while also trying to limit your opponent&rsquo;s! At the end of the round, a victory point is awarded to the player with the highest total score, as well as the player with the highest individual card score. Players' hands are carried over between rounds, allowing you to save powerful scoring combinations for just the right moment. After four rounds, whoever has the most victory points wins! Rules are also included for a three-player &quot;Captain&quot; variant, as well as a four-player &quot;Partnerships&quot; game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5zrrRGef6PGbxhL1t7g87g__original/img/zuh5PQPMskc-ziege5PlFTaSoy0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8081358.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5zrrRGef6PGbxhL1t7g87g__thumb/img/i2IMyJ7pBcXoiSqEUXidpkMwJKQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8081358.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Chaining","Score-and-Reset Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.53715,"averageRating":7.38333,"rank":13507,"designers":["Mike Fitzgerald"],"publishers":["PLAAY NOW","R&R Games"],"artists":["Sam Avallone"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
