{"gameId":305761,"name":"Whale Riders","description":"You are a whale rider. For generations, your people have known and lived with the ice whales and together you've bought and traded at the busy ports along the fabled Ice Coast. You are honored to be the latest in your family to sail with the whales &mdash; but the ice is thickening and the glaciers are moving. A deep winter is coming, the fiercest for centuries. You decide to ride your mount one final time before the snows come to buy and sell as much as you can...and maybe even collect some precious pearls along the way.&#10;&#10;Whale Riders is a new design with a classic feel from game designer Reiner Knizia. In 45 minutes of play, 2-6 players race to the end of the Ice Coast and back, buying and selling as many resources as possible to make the money needed to acquire the richest prizes. Will you skip opportunities to gain the greatest treasure, or will you make your money slowly along the way?&#10;&#10;Each player has two actions per turn, but a lot they want to accomplish. Sail? Buy? Sell? Draw more order cards? All the while, your opponents might be sailing past and beating you to what's on offer down the coast! Once all the precious pearls have been purchased, the game ends and the player with the most pearls wins!&#10;&#10;Whale Riders has simple and short rules, but offers a lot of interaction and interesting decisions for players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SITRasdETcDI4bQ2Ks4K0Q__original/img/9I-x1EZlZFakWbdHJ9FbuiJTH9c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5421573.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SITRasdETcDI4bQ2Ks4K0Q__thumb/img/xYAzyVVDh4WQuyq3GwbmZnl3jWI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5421573.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Contracts","Hand Management","Market","Race"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.9849,"averageRating":7.06401,"rank":2800,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["Grail Games","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","SD Games"],"artists":["Vincent Dutrait"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":6,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":14,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":8,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":2,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
