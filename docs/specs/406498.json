{"gameId":406498,"name":"Caf√© Baras","description":"Everyone in town is looking for a cozy little caf&eacute; where they can relax with a good book, something to nibble on, and, of course, some delicious caffeinated beverages. As a capybara with a love for coffee, it&rsquo;s always been a dream of yours to open your own shop. Now is the perfect time! But you&rsquo;re not the only one opening your doors in hopes of enticing customers. Rival coffee shops are popping up all over town and it&rsquo;s up to you to ensure that you have the right food, drinks, and decor to turn your drop-ins into regulars. Put together a delicious menu and decorate your shop to capture the perfect aesthetic. You just might have the busiest little caf&eacute; in town!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you play a card from your hand, either buying it as a food, drink, or decor item for your caf&eacute; or serving the customer on the card and earning money. If you meet a customer&rsquo;s needs completely, they become a Regular and earn you extra end game points!&#10;&#10;Caf&eacute; Baras is a card drafting, tableau-building game brought to you by the creative team behind the critter classics Creature Comforts and Maple Valley. Designed by Roberta Taylor and featuring illustrations by Cindy Monroy, it plays 2-4 baristas in about 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sV-BgLSSo1L6C0m8fqF98w__original/img/P7TabR3QE5AIXLFAREqSnll3MHI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7899404.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sV-BgLSSo1L6C0m8fqF98w__thumb/img/YKGKqAoiq_jWLftmXQom71PrSV8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7899404.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Multi-Use Cards"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.57692,"rank":-1,"designers":["Roberta Taylor"],"publishers":["Kids Table BG"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
