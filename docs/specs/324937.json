{"gameId":324937,"name":"Wiz-War (9th Edition)","description":"In Wiz-War, players are transformed into wizards who attempt to collect treasures from a twisted maze.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the game is a deck of cards that the players use to cast spells, power up spells, and augment movement. Each turn, players can move up to three spaces (or more with the use of number cards). However, the goal is to penetrate the other players' sections of the maze, pick up one of their treasures, and bring it back to your home base. The first player to capture two such treasures or kill all the other wizards wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bMcEMM5qurvnJxcosswjWg__original/img/Qpbm-L1d7fSMkfZaTX-5bLdchcg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5799068.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bMcEMM5qurvnJxcosswjWg__thumb/img/Tjj681UWYL-zhdmd6KaUSvguHQY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5799068.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Map Deformation","Modular Board","Player Elimination"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.6,"rank":-1,"designers":["Tom Jolly"],"publishers":["Steve Jackson Games"],"artists":["Phil Foglio"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
