{"gameId":401182,"name":"The Sixth Realm","description":"A dwarven merchant ship sailing to Merchants Cove noticed that the poisonous miasma surrounding the land had been lifted. Word quickly made its way to Queen Tabitha who organized excursions to this new land. What they found shocked them; this was their ancestral homeland, and the six races used to live in peace. Peace and harmony had returned to the Five Realms, and thus the ancient curse had been lifted. &#10;&#10;In The Sixth Realm, players assume the role of explorers who&rsquo;ve sailed to this new (old) continent. With the backing of the crown and help from the guilds, players will compete to make a name for themselves in this strange new land.&#10;&#10;A game of The Sixth Realm takes place over three rounds.  Each round, the Stone Council will meet seven times, determining in which order each of the six guilds are going to activate. Players will then have the ability to take actions based on the selected guild. By exhausting their supplies of precious resources they will be able to take stronger actions, or even petition to take a different guild's actions.&#10;&#10;The Sixth Realm is a heavy euro game with combos, bonuses, engine building, and interaction. The player-driven scoring and action-selection mechanisms mean that no two games play out the same. You must carefully balance long-term strategic planning, short-term  tactical adjustments, and the desires of your opponents to make a name for yourself as you return to the homeland of your ancient ancestors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_39NP2aY8K8VrBv2vg_JTQ__original/img/RqV_h5Y6xR83xcDObJql_MgRAmE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8034704.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_39NP2aY8K8VrBv2vg_JTQ__thumb/img/kJ4NuSQuTY1Un4eFxl45n6xYe_U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8034704.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Action Points","Chaining","End Game Bonuses","Market","Movement Points","Network and Route Building","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Track Movement","Turn Order: Claim Action"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.50912,"averageRating":6.48271,"rank":21198,"designers":["Matthew Dunstan","Seth Jaffee","Drake Villareal"],"publishers":["Final Frontier Games"],"artists":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":8,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":9,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":6,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":6,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
