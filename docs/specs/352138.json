{"gameId":352138,"name":"Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City","description":"Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City is a big box strategy game with miniatures in which gangs fight for control of a city, with the city also being a living part of the game.&#10;&#10;1 to 4 players take on the role of ruthless gangs vying for control of the underground in the glittering hellhole that is Night City. Clash with other Gangs in the meat or on the Net, as your enterprising band of toughs seeks to gain dominance over the criminal underworld that rules the streets. Only the boldest will be remembered, and your Street Cred will pave your way to the top.&#10;&#10;In Single Player mode, you are pitted against an opposing Gang and an Edgerunner (Johnny or either V's) in a free-for-all for Night City. Similar to the multiplayer mode, the faction with the most Street Cred wins.&#10;&#10;In the game, players assume the role of a gang leader, with you organizing your gang members to take power in the city. Your actions affect not only your game and your opponents but the city itself. Each gang has different attributes and goals, giving each player a different gaming experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SVxlNXnR86aDnVqLFjgHnw__original/img/ZGb7vEvSWDKlBoqlvYMsH0NELj4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8028015.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SVxlNXnR86aDnVqLFjgHnw__thumb/img/JlXd6FUY1io7RRfPQfCd6XaiBMQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8028015.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.85514,"averageRating":7.55649,"rank":3904,"designers":["Andrea Chiarvesio","Eric M.
