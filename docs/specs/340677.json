{"gameId":340677,"name":"Bad Company","description":"Build your own gang and customize it to suit your plans. Gather resources to complete heists and money to recruit new gang members. And make sure you escape the police! A unique and fun game from the award-winning designers of Automania and Trails of Tucana.&#10;&#10;Bad Company supports up to 6 players with very little downtime. It also includes a solo mode where you try to outsmart the police.&#10;&#10;Each player has a player board with 11 gang members. You may upgrade them by placing overlapping cards onto them. This way, the visual appearances of your gang members change as they gain more abilities.&#10;&#10;Each round, the active player rolls four dice and divides them into two pairs (pay coins to reroll). Each pair of dice activates one gang member on the active player's board.  All other players may use one of the pairs to activate a single gang member on their own boards.&#10;&#10;Activating a gangster provides resources needed to complete heists, money to upgrade your gang members, or advance your car through the city. &#10;You want to advance your car, because you need to stay ahead of the police in order to collect loot along the city route.&#10;&#10;You gain points by completing heists, upgrading your gang and by driving your car through the city.&#10;Some completed heists provide special abilities which you can build your strategy around.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player completes their 6th heist, or when any car reaches the dock on the city track, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M7sjJ0awBaSnbaY00czejQ__original/img/Veug66xKLjQPBlkER0QQtnCUBzA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6241310.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M7sjJ0awBaSnbaY00czejQ__thumb/img/H2Fj2TT9IrZieiGGfYzz2IvnMOs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6241310.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Contracts","Dice Rolling","Re-rolling and Locking","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Track Movement","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.59422,"averageRating":7.63854,"rank":7582,"designers":["Kenneth Minde","Eilif Svensson","Kristian Amundsen Ã˜stby"],"publishers":["Aporta Games"],"artists":["Gjermund Bohne"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
