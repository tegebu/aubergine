Out in the wild, you can find them butting heads trying to show off their strength and impress their insect friends with their wrestling skills. This is the origin of the phenomenal World Insect Wrestling Championship.&#10;&#10;In Kabuto Sumo, you are one of the contending beetles that is battling for supremacy in the ring and your place in the pantheon of legendary wrestlers. The gameplay of Kabuto Sumo resembles the coin-pusher arcade games in which you strategically drop quarters and anxiously anticipate coins cascading off the platform. This game features a similar experience, with you trying to strategically slide pieces onto the board and push the other players out of the ring. It's an exciting combination of dexterity, strategy, and luck.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fG4GxTHRYGasb0WYE-udJQ__original/img/uenvywev5fgsuZZqCmMTDAY-MLQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6256515.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fG4GxTHRYGasb0WYE-udJQ__thumb/img/VxiuAUI5idseMgx-yLPKgnsnlsY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6256515.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Slide/Push","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.87444,"averageRating":7.28074,"rank":3202,"designers":["Tony Miller"],"publishers":["BoardGameTables.com"],"artists":["Kwanchai Moriya"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":7,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
