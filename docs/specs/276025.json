{"gameId":276025,"name":"Maracaibo","description":"Maracaibo, the new strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is set in the Caribbean during the 17th century. The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean, e.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various&nbsp;actions or deliver goods to. One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story.&#10;&#10;As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister.&#10;&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Spanish version of Maracaibo contains La Armada mini-expansion packaged inside the base game's box.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__original/img/yhnCcq9UplffqjSCe08mjTFvgOM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4917407.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMNa0k05zMdKgSEp26Q3Tw__thumb/img/lVlnhYyxlZb3WuKZJHLoJcFHEjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4917407.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Events","Hand Management","Income","Movement Points","Narrative Choice / Paragraph","Point to Point Movement","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Stock Holding","Sudden Death Ending","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Track Movement","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":7.79689,"averageRating":8.24503,"rank":37,"designers":["Alexander Pfister"],"publishers":["Game's Up","BoardM Factory","Capstone Games","dlp games","Ediciones MasQueOca","Fishbone Games","Hobby World","MeepleBR","Super Meeple","テンデイズゲームズ (Ten Days Games)","uplay.it edizioni","YOKA Games"],"artists":["Fiore GmbH","Aline Kirrmann"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":25,"recommended":120,"notRecommended":26,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":45,"recommended":135,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":123,"recommended":60,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":35,"recommended":87,"notRecommended":51,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":99,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
