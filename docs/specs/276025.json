{"gameId":276025,"name":"Maracaibo","description":"Maracaibo, the new strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is set in the Caribbean during the 17th century. The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean, e.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various&nbsp;actions or deliver goods to. One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story.&#10;&#10;As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Spanish version of Maracaibo contains the La Armada mini-expansion packaged inside the base game's box.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/qP99uYh6kOi_erZTgkYDe_AVSsw=/0x0/pic4917407.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/lVlnhYyxlZb3WuKZJHLoJcFHEjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4917407.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Events","Hand Management","Income","Legacy Game","Movement Points","Narrative Choice / Paragraph","Point to Point Movement","Race","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Sudden Death Ending","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Track Movement","Variable Setup"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":7.6685,"averageRating":8.33482,"rank":51,"designers":["Alexander Pfister"],"publishers":["Game's Up","BoardM Factory","Capstone Games","dlp games","Ediciones MasQueOca","Fishbone Games","Meeple BR Jogos","Super Meeple","YOKA Games"],"artists":["Fiore GmbH","Aline Kirrmann"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":21,"recommended":77,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":35,"recommended":91,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":82,"recommended":43,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":28,"recommended":56,"notRecommended":35,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":71,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
