{"gameId":334986,"name":"Daybreak","description":"Daybreak is a co-operative game about climate action. Each player controls a world power, deploying policies and technologies to both dismantle the engine of global heating and to build resilient societies that protect people from life-threatening crises.&#10;&#10;If the global temperature gets too high, or if too many people from any world power are in crisis, everyone loses.
