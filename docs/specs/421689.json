{"gameId":421689,"name":"Expeditions: Gears of Corruption","description":"Following a series of expeditions&mdash;some successful, others not&mdash;into the frigid Siberian tundra, corruption has spread from animals and people to a much larger threat. New heroes, better prepared than their predecessors, gather to face the prospect of a mechanical monster, but the changing landscape brings greater uncertainty as they explore Tunguska with fresh eyes.&#10;&#10;The Gears of Corruption expansion to Expeditions adds elements of risk and danger in the form of secret bonuses on map tokens and a corrupted mech that roams the land. To counter these threats, the expansion offers 2 new mechs and 4 new character/companion pairs, as well as components for a 6th player. Gears of Corruption also accelerates early gameplay by giving players starting resources and a hero worker that can act as any type of worker.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O3DXJ_f_IKJZblCpPcEPgw__original/img/Ca0Bo8ipgSvaFPI6v9jXWDTuSh0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8221886.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O3DXJ_f_IKJZblCpPcEPgw__thumb/img/OQeU2p15ZyfCeDKXc2aUgOaQ8jU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8221886.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":[],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.98077,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jamey Stegmaier"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games"],"artists":["Jakub Rozalski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
