{"gameId":73439,"name":"Troyes","description":"In Troyes (pronounced &quot;twah&quot;), players recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France. Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil. Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them &mdash; anything for more fame!&#10;&#10;Make your underlings:&#10;&#10;&#10;     work on the cathedral&#10;     combat misfortune&#10;     bustle about the city&#10;     and other such tasks that are below your family's stature&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Many editions of Troyes released in 2016 or later include rules for a solo variant as well as four bonus cards originally released in 2011 as a promotional item. Versions released prior to this date contain rules only for games with 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBIe-aEPtJKC-ceNlspK6A__original/img/otcIVdG4ebZmK1SjUtzma18JtJ4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic750583.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBIe-aEPtJKC-ceNlspK6A__thumb/img/Npv5mrWBkjnlKjl_8hGLNk9CCwc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic750583.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Hidden Victory Points","Income","Ownership","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement with Dice Workers","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2010,"bggRating":7.53412,"averageRating":7.73006,"rank":97,"designers":["Sébastien Dujardin","Xavier Georges","Alain Orban"],"publishers":["Pearl Games","Asmodee","Galápagos Jogos","HUCH!","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Z-Man Games"],"artists":["Alexandre Roche"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":5,"recommended":51,"notRecommended":212,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":108,"recommended":278,"notRecommended":48,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":303,"recommended":129,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":92,"recommended":225,"notRecommended":69,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":207,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
