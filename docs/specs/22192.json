{"gameId":22192,"name":"HeroQuest Advanced Quest","description":"HeroQuest Advanced Quest Edition (also known by the German version name &quot;HeroQuest Master Edition&quot;) is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests.  Miniature plastic characters and doll-house style furniture make this game very approachable.  Expansions were also released for this system.&#10;&#10;The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and number of expansions.&#10;&#10;HeroQuest Advanced Quest Edition adds 12 miniatures (&quot;black guards&quot;) with 4 kinds of detachable weapons and a new 13 part adventure &quot;The Dark Company&quot; to the basic HeroQuest Box.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Yd8M8-2rYPMiMcG4Y4UEA47lP6o=/0x0/pic775003.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/jRsvnCOO5tGP_Ga6UV1b0a4xBZY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic775003.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Modular Board","Role Playing","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1990,"bggRating":6.25057,"averageRating":7.31693,"rank":1517,"designers":["Stephen Baker"],"publishers":["MB Giochi","Milton Bradley"],"artists":["Les Edwards"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":18,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":4,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":15,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
