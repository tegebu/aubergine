{"gameId":398388,"name":"Oxono","description":"To win Oxono, you must be the first player to line up 4 pieces of your colour or 4 pieces of the same symbol, orthogonally. At each turn, you take 2 actions: move a totem of your choice (X or O) as many squares as you like, but always in the same row (horizontally or vertically), then place one of your pieces with the same symbol as the totem played, on a free square orthogonally around the totem's new position. You can only move a totem if you still have pieces of the same symbol in reserve, otherwise you will be forced to play the other totem.&#10;&#10;The most original aspect of Oxono is when a totem is completely surrounded. You can then play the totem over the surrounding pieces, and if you land on another encircled square, you can place your piece anywhere on the board. Note that you can use your opponent's colour to win by aligning symbols. The turnarounds are surprising for a game that lasts only 15 minutes and the replayability is maximum. The game feeling is very satisfying and the desire for revenge is immediate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description form the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B_RqU_iiz79iSg-2QFKlzA__original/img/zqw_5CefzWA9BhnIITBBblZgNJ8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7678962.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B_RqU_iiz79iSg-2QFKlzA__thumb/img/q_y6kC0JIXqiVi73so2Gcch72GA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7678962.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Square Grid"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.50608,"averageRating":6.08824,"rank":20172,"designers":["Jérémy Partinico"],"publishers":["Cosmoludo"],"artists":["Tom Delahaye"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
