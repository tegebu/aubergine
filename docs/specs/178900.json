{"gameId":178900,"name":"Codenames","description":"Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames &mdash; single-word labels like &quot;disease&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, and &quot;carrot&quot;. Yes, carrot. It's a legitimate codename. Each spymaster wants their team to identify their agents first...without uncovering the assassin by mistake.&#10;&#10;In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Lay out 25 cards, each bearing a single word. The spymasters look at a card showing the identity of each card, then take turns clueing their teammates. A clue consists of a single word and a number, with the number suggesting how many cards in play have some association to the given clue word. The teammates then identify one agent they think is on their team; if they're correct, they can keep guessing up to one more than the stated number of times; if the agent belongs to the opposing team or is an innocent bystander, the team's turn ends; and if they fingered the assassin, they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Spymasters continue giving clues until one team has identified all of their agents or the assassin has removed one team from play.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nC6ifPCDnAItwoKSKXVrnw__original/img/Id-jjIer_61ZbvI2_RVRCeBZFY4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8907965.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nC6ifPCDnAItwoKSKXVrnw__thumb/img/1iZav_8ZqurrDbvkZA9GcFhB5x0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8907965.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Communication Limits","Deduction","Memory","Race","Team-Based Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2015,"bggRating":7.43769,"averageRating":7.53314,"rank":156,"designers":["Vlaada Chvátil"],"publishers":["Czech Games Edition","asmodee","Boardgame Space","Brain Games","Broadway Toys LTD","Cranio Creations","Cuaca Cerah Games","Devir","DiceTree Games","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma)","Fantasmagoria","Feelindigo","GaGa Games","Gaming Library","Gém Klub Kft.","Golden Egg Games","HeidelBÄR Games","Heidelberger Spieleverlag","Hobby Japan","IELLO","Kaissa Chess & Games","Land of Beautiful Mind (سرزمین ذهن زیبا)","Lex Games","Liam Games","MINDOK","MIPL","More Fun Co., Ltd.","Nordic Games ehf","One Moment Games","Ponva d.o.o.","Pridemage Games","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","SuperHeated Neurons","TWOPLUS Games","White Goblin Games"],"artists":["Vlaada Chvátil","Stéphane Gantiez","Dávid Jablonovský","Tomáš Kučerovský","Filip Murmak","František Sedláček"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1019,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":13,"recommended":155,"notRecommended":923,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":150,"notRecommended":912,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":399,"recommended":715,"notRecommended":140,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":40,"recommended":745,"notRecommended":305,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1045,"recommended":210,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":137,"recommended":721,"notRecommended":211,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":8,"best":729,"recommended":381,"notRecommended":71,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":8,"best":148,"recommended":459,"notRecommended":321,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
