{"gameId":332290,"name":"Stardew Valley: The Board Game","description":"A cooperative board game of farming and friendship based on the Stardew Valley video game by Eric Barone. Work together with your fellow farmers to save the Valley from the nefarious JojaMart Corporation! To do this, you'll need to farm, fish, friend and find all kinds of different resources to fulfill your Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center. Collect all kinds of items, raise animals, and explore the Mine. Gain powerful upgrades and skills and as the seasons pass see if you're able to protect the magic of Stardew Valley!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to complete Grandpa's Goals and restore the Community Center, which requires you to gather different types of resources represented by tiles. You have a fixed amount of turns to accomplish this. This is driven by the Season Deck of 20 cards, one of which is drawn each turn to trigger certain events. Cooperatively the players decide each turn where they will focus their individual actions and place their pawn in that part of the Valley. Using their actions, they visit specific locations, trying to gather resources to complete their collective goals. Actions include things like: watering crops, trying to catch fish, rolling dice to explore the mines, and many more. When the Season Deck is exhausted, the game ends.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X2_yPTRxXj__14Y0yQTTqw__original/img/iBVQOPH1TitxQWfCOklzGNUTc8A=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6006003.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X2_yPTRxXj__14Y0yQTTqw__thumb/img/T13ceraa_S1wqEA9xMs_xQDW5es=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6006003.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":200,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Die Icon Resolution","Events","Point to Point Movement","Random Production","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Eric Barone","Cole Medeiros"],"publishers":["ConcernedApe"],"artists":["Gustavo \"Goose\" Gutierrez","Justin Williams","Luke Aiello","Christine MacTernan","Ed Puella","Rachel Lapidow","Gina Salvador"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
