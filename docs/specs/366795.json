{"gameId":366795,"name":"Dead Reckoning: Letters of Marque","description":"After year of the New Sea being the dominion of cutthroat pirates, and daring merchant adventurers, the empires of the old world have turned their gaze towards its waters.&#10;&#10;Letters of Marque is the third Saga expansion for Dead Reckoning. It contains 2 distinct but interconnected sets of expansion content. The first is &quot;Flags of the Old World&quot;, a non-saga based set of content that introduces 2 empire boards, new resources called &quot;Prime Cargo&quot;, new ship upgrades and a new &quot;Explorer&quot; card for each player's deck. The second is a new Saga, which, like to prior Saga expansions, contains encounters, mysteries, cards and content all to be organically while playing the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nhTBMKCWBqlLEd5z01P0Iw__original/img/CCtsKNNtL4XUfyqlLOTDGEtZstU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7003493.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nhTBMKCWBqlLEd5z01P0Iw__thumb/img/DrZsKJ99KuP4RWkHpUB8JXPE_KM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7003493.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Cube Tower","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Layering","Modular Board"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["John D.
