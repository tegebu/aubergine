{"gameId":256730,"name":"Pipeline","description":"The refinement of oil has long been part of the government-controlled energy sector. Amassed with an incredibly complex and inefficient system of refineries, the government has felt the severe pressures of worldwide demand and the ever-increasing global standards for refinement. Unable to keep up with demand, the government has only one option: privatizing the oil industry.&#10;&#10;This is where you come in. Seeking to capitalize on this new opportunity, in Pipeline you start a company in the oil business. You will focus on building a much more efficient pipeline network in your refinery, hiring experts that provide valuable benefits over your competitors, and managing the logistics of purchasing and selling your refined oil in the various markets. You will need more than strong economic skills &ndash; carefully crafting an interweaving network of pipelines just might ensure your victory!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x39hXnP-GkLN1CDEq932oA__original/img/dns582_OrWD9ZbABtUmXcQOxguQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4227162.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x39hXnP-GkLN1CDEq932oA__thumb/img/xxiGCk0hEUpP3hOtItpKI3sKZfo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4227162.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Commodity Speculation","Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Market","Network and Route Building","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Claim Action"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":6.97039,"averageRating":7.70038,"rank":426,"designers":["Ryan Courtney"],"publishers":["Capstone Games","Game Harbor","Maldito Games","sternenschimmermeer"],"artists":["Ian O'Toole"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":50,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":34,"recommended":52,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":51,"recommended":31,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":19,"recommended":47,"notRecommended":20,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":46,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
