{"gameId":420443,"name":"TREOS","description":"On a stormy night, rumor spreads about a luck potion that one can buy for 20 gold coins on the black market in TREOS. The realm is vast, its forests dark and the roads dangerous.&#10;&#10;Courier runs pay richly, so each one dares to venture outside the protective walls of their home town...&#10;&#10;Players have to choose among 4 asymmetrical characters, deal with highwaymen and other obstacles and - most of all - outmaneuver the competition.&#10;&#10;The game is played over several rounds (called days), composed of 5 phases each. Movement cards are drawn and must be chosen wisely, because only the numbers on the cards will reveal the turn order. Each round you will be planning three turns, which you will then carry out one by one. This cycle repeats until someone collects 20 gold (or more), thus immediately winning the game.&#10;&#10;As if that weren't enough adventure, the map offers a completely new world with every game: the game board can be arranged in more than 1.500 variations!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NzndVcwLdlXDFfJ48Q9KVA__original/img/X_ZOZjItUIqqeqPH7osD_mXMt5g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8184722.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NzndVcwLdlXDFfJ48Q9KVA__thumb/img/YH0ZrHOMYg7lMer0fOdLFMewE4o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8184722.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":80,"mechanics":["Action Points","Contracts","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Moving Multiple Units","Point to Point Movement","Programmed Movement","Race","Simultaneous Action Selection","Turn Order: Auction","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.50161,"averageRating":5.70526,"rank":22175,"designers":["Arne aus dem Siepen"],"publishers":["Lookout Games"],"artists":["Gabriel Campagnolo"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
