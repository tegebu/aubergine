{"gameId":300877,"name":"New York Zoo","description":"Puzzling and animal breeding: Designer Uwe Rosenberg is at his best! In New York Zoo, you are constructing an animal park. Build animal enclosures, introduce new animals and raise their offspring. The game play is straight forward as you have only two turn options: Puzzle a new enclosure tile into your zoo area or gain new animals to populate your animal encounters. But be sure to time your actions well since you want your zoo to participate in as many animal breedings as possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8vqr1uYik715mqDqy0W9vg__original/img/kZMCwnaVV_hK6prPbXXjjWqOjP4=/0x0/pic5673404.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8vqr1uYik715mqDqy0W9vg__thumb/img/Bu97VesRjdbQO2PxfuOrdC6icd8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5673404.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Automatic Resource Growth","Grid Coverage","Modular Board","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.90063,"averageRating":7.33781,"rank":2884,"designers":["Uwe Rosenberg"],"publishers":["Feuerland Spiele","Capstone Games","Cranio Creations","Maldito Games","Super Meeple"],"artists":["Felix Wermke"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":6,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
