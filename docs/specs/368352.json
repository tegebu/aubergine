{"gameId":368352,"name":"Satori","description":"Satori (&#230;&#130;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;) is a Japanese Buddhism term for awakening and refers to a full and deep experience of enlightenment.&#10;&#10;In Satori, players compete to advance on the spiritual path. For this end, you'll build new temples for the votaries to pray, get the wisest monks and contribute to build up the great pagoda to turn Koyasan in the heart of the zen Buddhism.&#10;&#10;On your turn, choose one of the available devotees at the tori and take him to a temple to resolve an action. You might get resources or resolve different actions on the temples. You can also bring your monks to the mountains which allow you to concatenate additional actions and advance on the spiritual path.&#10;&#10;The farthest player on the spiritual path will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NQcETSO7FzG1nXj5vmZjgg__original/img/HNIpwgklKn-spC_oFtqxsYp9SyQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7539533.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NQcETSO7FzG1nXj5vmZjgg__thumb/img/1w-bJRyN3gXkU8-3uNYb_OgF8tw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7539533.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.54837,"averageRating":8.50667,"rank":11565,"designers":["Paco Yanez"],"publishers":["Perro Loko Games"],"artists":["Edu Valls"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
