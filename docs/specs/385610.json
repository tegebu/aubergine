{"gameId":385610,"name":"Kutná Hora: The City of Silver","description":"Join other ambitious guild leaders in mining and developing the famous City of Silver during its period of rapid economic growth and expansion in the 14th century &mdash; from the first discovery of silver near the Cistercian monastery to the construction of Kutn&aacute; Hora, which quickly became one of the most important cities in central Europe.&#10;&#10;Kutn&aacute; Hora: The City of Silver is a historical city-building Eurogame for 2-4 players that features a real-life supply and demand experience in which every action you take has an impact on the game's dynamic economic systems.&#10;&#10;In each round, players take turns selecting actions from a hand of double-sided cards to engage strategic plans like mining, purchasing plots of land on which to build, gaining permits, raising buildings for their affiliated guilds, gaining profit from their production, and of course working towards the construction of Saint Barbara's Cathedral.&#10;&#10;The asymmetrical nature of each player's available guilds makes for highly interactive rounds in which each decision impacts the economy and other players in interesting ways as they expand their mines and build infrastructure across a shared board.&#10;&#10;Mine ore and smelt it into a fortune of silver for expanding this beautiful historic city, but take care to balance your personal goal advancement with the need to further the city's growth. Everything is connected, and sometimes the path to personal victory relies on the prosperity of the many.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ar_YhktX6VcXBLcEfnu_dw__original/img/QyKTmZomxKVYO_uY5OjaojFQNUk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7464921.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ar_YhktX6VcXBLcEfnu_dw__thumb/img/XlZo63iHoNfh7yKZdJiJj2Wfglo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7464921.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Action/Event","Events","Hand Management","Multi-Use Cards","Square Grid","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.21138,"averageRating":7.82398,"rank":1930,"designers":["Ondřej Bystroň","Petr Čáslava","Pavel Jarosch"],"publishers":["Czech Games Edition","Cranio Creations","HeidelBÄR Games","IELLO","MINDOK","Rebel Sp. z o.o."],"artists":["Štěpán Drašťák","Dávid Jablonovský","Jakub Politzer","Milan Vavroň"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":23,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":23,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":30,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
