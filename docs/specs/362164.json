{"gameId":362164,"name":"Pioneer Rails","description":"In Pioneer Rails, you represent a railroad owner who has seen an opportunity to expand your empire across the new lands of the frontier. You&rsquo;ll be competing with other railroad owners to plan your railway in the best way possible to connect establishments to the railroad and satisfy the demands of the locals.&#10;&#10;Pioneer Rails is a Flip &amp; Write game where you&rsquo;ll use poker cards to extend your railway tracks and build a poker hand at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each turn you&rsquo;ll choose one of the revealed poker cards. The suit of the card helps you extend your railway, connecting you to new towns and surrounding features. When you connect to a town, you&rsquo;ll gain the ability to do a one time bonus. When you surround a feature with your tracks, you&rsquo;ll activate it for end game scoring. The value of the card is added to your poker hand, which you'll score additional points for at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Each game you&rsquo;ll also be competing over 3 goals, meaning every game you&rsquo;ll be pulled in different directions.&#10;&#10;The mechanism of surrounding features to activate them gives Pioneer Rails a satisfying &lsquo;puzzley&rsquo; feel to the game. The variable objectives and the poker cards give enough replayability so no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zFtCdg2K7NEV9BPaEzgAbQ__original/img/DJikn7JFCiBKxk7XzEk2BTkZ__A=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6842458.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zFtCdg2K7NEV9BPaEzgAbQ__thumb/img/bBiYmNxEpal0mKl7LCtLcINF9eU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6842458.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":80,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Contracts","Line Drawing","Network and Route Building","Paper-and-Pencil"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.04167,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jeffrey D.
