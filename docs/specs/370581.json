{"gameId":370581,"name":"Fractured Sky","description":"Fractured Sky is a game of deduction, sneaky strategy, and resource management set on a fantastical island. Players lead their kingdom in the hunt for shards of fractured falling stars, which are rumored to grant wishes to those that can amass enough of them.&#10;&#10;Using airships, players send their armies to regions with the star shards, but finding those is not always easy and hiring seers to predict their falls can be worth the investment. Over time, players will increase their presence on the island, placing permanent buildings to give them advantages like extra resources or increasing the size of their troop numbers.&#10;&#10;Only one wish will be granted, so who will amass the most shards before the final star falls?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xmxjHx8M0wzOHdcNe62Qpw__original/img/pHaUaQEoQveWLd_teNTUIMNCURg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7324567.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xmxjHx8M0wzOHdcNe62Qpw__thumb/img/0mxPEvswlX54bVd39J1cSnZIRws=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7324567.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":75,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Constrained Bidding","Deduction"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.71521,"averageRating":7.74788,"rank":5383,"designers":["Max Anderson","Zac Dixon","Austin Harrison"],"publishers":["IV Studio (IV Games)"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":4,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
