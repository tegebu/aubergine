{"gameId":352515,"name":"Trio","description":"nana, which was later reprinted as Trio, is a card game in which players are looking for three of a kind.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 36 cards, numbered 1-12 three times. Players receive some cards in hand, which they are required to sort from low to high, and the remaining cards are placed face down on the table.&#10;&#10;On your turn, choose any single card to reveal, either the low or high card from a player's hand (including your own) or any face-down card from the table. Then, do this again. If the two cards show the same number, continue your turn; if they do not, return the cards to where they came from and end your turn.&#10;&#10;If you reveal three cards showing the same number, take these cards as a set in front of you. If you are the first player to collect three sets, you win &mdash; except that a player wins immediately if they collect the set of 7s or two sets that add or subtract to 7, e.g., 4s and 11s.&#10;&#10;Note that nana and Trio contain identical components, but nana is labeled for 2-5 players, while Trio is labeled for 3-6 players. Trio has slight changes to the rules, with players using all cards no matter the player count. Additionally, you play in normal mode &mdash; winning with three sets or the 7s &mdash; or &quot;spicy&quot; mode, winning with two linked sets or the 7s. Finally, Trio includes rules for playing in teams with four or six players.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d9F0ZDqcN3J7J92WckyraQ__original/img/3OAIArHm3Z_j5bAJeJlU5LKQie0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7605785.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d9F0ZDqcN3J7J92WckyraQ__thumb/img/8d663Cj-RQy8pA8gZOcO80xYI5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7605785.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Matching","Memory","Questions and Answers","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.55004,"averageRating":7.29247,"rank":1118,"designers":["宮野 華也 (Kaya Miyano)"],"publishers":["Cocktail Games","Mob+ (Mob Plus)","Broadway Toys LTD","Games7Days","Ghenos Games","Happy Camper","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd","PaperGames (III)","Randolph","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Reflexshop","REXhry","TWOPLUS Games","Underdog Games (II)"],"artists":["Laura Michaud","別府さい (Sai Beppu)"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":33,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":31,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":5,"recommended":26,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":37,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":16,"recommended":23,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":12,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
