{"gameId":411396,"name":"Quiet House","description":"Wandering ghosts in search of refuge have discovered an abandoned mansion. Inside this old and cozy mansion, the ghosts were all content, but they had different ideas about the arrangement of five statues scattered throughout the grand hall. To place the statues to their liking, the ghosts began moving them around at random. Can they find a placement that satisfies everyone before daybreak?&#10;&#10;Quiet House is a co-operative game in which players take turns moving statues to create arrangements that meet the goals. At the start of the game, goal tiles are assigned, indicating how the statues should be placed for a victory. However, players have only partial information about these goals and cannot communicate with each other regarding them. Success in the game relies on careful observation of others' moves, making guesses about the goals they know, and collaborating effectively to achieve the correct arrangement promptly.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-rMjObWxnz47OMI4y3Tkmg__original/img/Sf7lscMJ6ysQ3wLkaMiQ1NcqAmc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7963403.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-rMjObWxnz47OMI4y3Tkmg__thumb/img/kLQXuzhkOcgT4uXnpdpXv_rm-zw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7963403.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Roles with Asymmetric Information"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.05,"rank":-1,"designers":["Emanuele Briano"],"publishers":["Mandoo Games"],"artists":["Marion Aupied"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
