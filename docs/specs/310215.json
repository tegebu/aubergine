{"gameId":310215,"name":"7 Wonders Duel: Solo","description":"Home alone?&#10;No opponents available to play 7 Wonder Duel with you?&#10;Or maybe your partner / companion beats you every time?&#10;&#10;With our editor, Repos Production, Antoine and I have created this mini expansion of 7 Wonders Duel, which allows you to play the game SOLO, facing one of the 5 charismatic leaders.&#10;&#10;How does it work?&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple:&#10;&#10;     Choose or randomly draw the Leader you will face&#10;     Each turn, turn over one of the 12 Decision Cards and follow the instructions&#10;     The Leader will build the selected card, regardless of whether they have the resources or not. (After all, they are Leaders, they have many privileges) &ndash; Sometimes, the Leader will even play twice in a row&#10;     Each of the Decision cards indicates the Leader&rsquo;s choice priorities, as well as the possibility of immediately replaying an additional round.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;When we say it is simple, we just mean the rules &ndash; not the strategy.&#10;We are just talking about learning the rules, and managing the game elements during the game. We would never have made a solo mode in the &ldquo;gas factory &raquo; style, as is often the case with solo adaptations ?.&#10;&#10;To be successful, you need to adapt to the strategy of your virtual opponents, and it will not be Byzantium every day (as Hammurabi said).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3hsHN8bfQ6AhyzuCjKW83Q__original/img/dj_QdgL3R90SeaDLpCAvUrHaP8E=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5428060.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3hsHN8bfQ6AhyzuCjKW83Q__thumb/img/-2Sgb2i1vcOnn3kvrhDO4l5lQXs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5428060.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Drafting","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.7558,"averageRating":7.94477,"rank":-1,"designers":["Antoine Bauza","Bruno Cathala"],"publishers":["Asmodee","(Web published)","Repos Production"],"artists":["Miguel Coimbra"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":8,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
