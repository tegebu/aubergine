{"gameId":311725,"name":"Dice Theme Park","description":"Dice Theme Park is a dice manipulation board game, all about creating and running your own park of fairground attractions.&#10;&#10;In Dice Theme Park, you are the park managers, trying to create the most successful theme park in the area, by getting your customers on the most rides possible! The dice in the game represent the customers, with hex tiles representing the rides in your park. Employing a unique &ldquo;Dice-cascade&rdquo; mechanic once a customer has enjoyed a ride, their dice value is reduced, but they can still continue to enjoy more rides in the theme park until their value drops to 0 where they exit. This means the more efficiently you can move your dice around to activate the most rewarding rides, the more points and money you receive!&#10;&#10;Dice Theme Park also features a card based turn initiative mechanic, decided by your special action role cards (with values 1-6), with players selecting two cards each turn. The lowest total will gain first choice of the customer dice draft and ride tiles that round. At the end of the round those cards will then be passed to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;Dice Theme Park is more interactive and slightly more complex than Dice Hospital, so it&rsquo;s perfect for those looking for a more challenging experience with more ways to score and play, whilst still keeping that same engaging and satisfying feel every time it is played.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/f-ayXeVk4snrTKfUwoZyig__original/img/CBk9mex-uxtu16WtLhqSH0cQTKc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5480434.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/f-ayXeVk4snrTKfUwoZyig__thumb/img/-TOLapifHCPr0GulTHNdGH5YSis=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5480434.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Hand Management","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Role Order","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.65945,"averageRating":7.03223,"rank":5888,"designers":["Adrian Adamescu","Daryl Andrews"],"publishers":["Alley Cat Games"],"artists":["Sabrina Miramon"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
