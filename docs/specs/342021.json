{"gameId":342021,"name":"Space Invaders","description":"Join the fight and stop the invasion!&#10;&#10;Based on the classic arcade game that started it all, play Space Invaders like never before! Can you team-up and defeat the alien invaders to claim victory, or will it be GAME OVER with the invaders winning? It's all hands-on deck as all players either win together or lose together in this collaborative strategy game.&#10;&#10;Take turns moving your 3D shooter and lining up the best shot. Launch blast tokens at the waves of descending invaders. You have limited shots, so all players need to co-ordinate their attack and hit their targets. Destroy all the invaders and take down the UFO mother ship before it's too late!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lH0TJT2KYBCrM_1sMf9huw__original/img/VR7fUgxnu_kJLUE08igTVHLhN9A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6273087.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lH0TJT2KYBCrM_1sMf9huw__thumb/img/WsjXUU73HRgfElL9F2149LRs1ig=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6273087.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Physical Removal","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.53258,"averageRating":7.09,"rank":12493,"designers":["Kane Klenko"],"publishers":["Buffalo Games"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
