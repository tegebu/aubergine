{"gameId":431929,"name":"Onward","description":"Onward is the spiritual successor to Skytear, the competitive card-driven game inspired by MOBA video games such as League of Legends or DOTA2.&#10;&#10;Players split into two teams, with each player controlling two or more champions.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy nexus that is a portal in the enemy base.&#10;&#10;The game takes 45 to 90 minutes depending on the map that can have two or three lanes.&#10;&#10;Lanes are corridors connecting the two nexuses and are populated with towers and minions from both teams.&#10;&#10;Towers are defense structures preventing enemy champions and minions from rushing into the nexus.&#10;&#10;Minions are weak units that grow in strength as they increase in number. They always try to advance toward the enemy nexus and attack any enemy in their way.&#10;&#10;Jungles are dangerous areas between lanes where champions can venture to defeat monsters to gain gold and buy powerful items.&#10;&#10;The river is a central area where your champions can go fight the colossal outsider... or die trying!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/As2LEVwwoHE9UEmaCekgAQ__original/img/WIa__KGWhvVDjq426Nib9GUgQoM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8729695.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/As2LEVwwoHE9UEmaCekgAQ__thumb/img/Fior2lF0mslMAa_i3KwgOdim1ps=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8729695.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Multi-Use Cards","Multiple Maps"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.71111,"rank":-1,"designers":["Giacomo Neri","Riccardo Neri"],"publishers":["Skytear Games"],"artists":["Vlad Botos","Douglas Deri","John Ric Detoon","Marko Fiedler","Gong Studios","Jack Kaiser","Jerry Padilla","Alba Palacio","Simon Pape","Janette Ramos"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
