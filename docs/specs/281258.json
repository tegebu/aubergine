{"gameId":281258,"name":"Sub Terra II: Inferno's Edge","description":"Sub Terra II: Inferno's Edge is a cooperative adventure board game. You and up to five friends must explore a tile-based volcano temple to steal a legendary artifact.  To get it, you must find the path to the inner sanctum, unlock the secrets within, then escape the way you came.&#10;&#10;This is a dangerous place. You'll need to work as a team to avoid deadly traps, brave scorching lava and defeat the temple's mysterious guardians. Stick together to share your skills, or split up to cover more ground. But beware - the volcano stirs beneath you, and you're running out of time...&#10;&#10;In Sub Terra II: Inferno's Edge, players will be progressively revealing new tiles, forming the board, mapping the volcanic temple from its sunlit entrance to its fiery core. As players explore through the temple, they will have to overcome obstacles, avoid hazardous terrain, and face the ferocious guardians of the 'artifact'. On each player's turn, after taking their actions, a random hazard will activate, making careful planning of actions essential to survival.&#10;&#10;Players must collectively locate and obtain 3 'keys', mysterious objects that are needed to gain entry to the chamber containing the legendary artifact. Your adventures must be quick, though, as the volcano stirs and as the game progresses you get closer to the volcano erupting, flipping tiles to completely inhospitable lava flows that will chase the adventurers from the cave.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IPMyu6Yj1j-fuQt0hgHINw__original/img/EJf4Ogge9qYHFLGzxcAAYTkGFhU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4933104.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IPMyu6Yj1j-fuQt0hgHINw__thumb/img/u1T6wKdSvBjUYzgZm9wAL1Zrj5M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4933104.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":75,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Map Addition","Modular Board","Network and Route Building","Pick-up and Deliver","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.02977,"averageRating":7.48444,"rank":2797,"designers":["Tim Pinder"],"publishers":["Inside the Box Board Games LLP (ITB)","Nuts!
