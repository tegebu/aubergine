{"gameId":283393,"name":"Aquatica","description":"Aquatica  is a deep, but easy to learn family engine builder about underwater kingdoms.&#10;&#10;In the game you will become one of the mighty ocean kings, struggling to bring glory to his realm. To win the game, you need to capture and buy locations, recruit new characters, and complete goals; each of these actions gives you victory points at the end of the game. To do so, you need to play cards from your hand (each with a unique set of actions) and combine them. Don't think it's simple! With a good strategy during your turn, you can take up to ten actions in a row.&#10;&#10;You will encounter plenty of mysterious ocean creatures and take them to your hand. With their help you will explore the unknown locations and raise found resources from the ocean depths to your kingdom. Mechanically this is represented with the help of three-layered player board and the unique mechanism of card-rising.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_8WvjlAU1_Y0qhwTjXvbnA__original/img/q01FWyijYaqvGhuwz-lkPBoxaRo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5578646.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_8WvjlAU1_Y0qhwTjXvbnA__thumb/img/8zjeyk9juPqsHIwuPt7wiZFia-M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5578646.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Card Drafting","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Drafting","Hand Management","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Slide/Push","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":6.69845,"averageRating":7.40829,"rank":750,"designers":["Ivan Tuzovsky"],"publishers":["Cosmodrome Games","Arcane Wonders","BoardM Factory","Broadway Toys LTD","Cranio Creations","Gigamic","Portal Games","数寄ゲームズ (Suki Games)"],"artists":["Irina Kuzmina","Andrew Modestov","Oleg Proshin","Artur Varenyev","Marat Zakirov"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":20,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":14,"recommended":25,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":27,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":7,"recommended":23,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
