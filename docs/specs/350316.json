{"gameId":350316,"name":"Wayfarers of the South Tigris","description":"Wayfarers of the South Tigris is set during the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, circa 820 AD. As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above. Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?&#10;&#10;The aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game's end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their progress. The game ends once one player&rsquo;s marker has reached the far right column of the journal track.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1dO66KB0b64xdbdHqf_UZg__original/img/mm97vM6TMukl6qLAT7AbzzaTEW4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6484574.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1dO66KB0b64xdbdHqf_UZg__thumb/img/P2w53HYEvQ_WJ55dOjxin_fUUes=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6484574.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","End Game Bonuses","Modular Board","Open Drafting","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Track Movement","Worker Placement with Dice Workers","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.46925,"averageRating":7.98265,"rank":1195,"designers":["S J Macdonald","Shem Phillips"],"publishers":["Garphill Games","Fever Games","Lord of Boards","Mosaico Jogos","Pixie Games","Primigenio","Reflexshop","Renegade Game Studios","Schwerkraft-Verlag","TLAMA games"],"artists":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":26,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":16,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
