{"gameId":20022,"name":"Terra Nova","description":"In Terra Nova, players try to claim areas of land by moving control markers and placing fences. Each turn, a player must take three actions, first moving a control marker, then taking two further actions from these possibilities: &#10;&#10;     moving a control marker (whether the same one or a different one) and/or&#10;     placing a fence next to a control marker that moved this turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;Areas are scored once they're enclosed and contain no more than three types of landscape. Whoever has the majority of pieces in an area scores points based on the number of spaces and the number of types of landscape in the area, with fewer types scoring more points. Points are split in case of a tie. The game ends once all areas have been scored.&#10;&#10;Winner of Premio Archimede 2004.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CCLEC71HhQfZfOD5mm6MVw__original/img/D09OFdf50VPbr50bG2wFjqGVhcM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic696514.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CCLEC71HhQfZfOD5mm6MVw__thumb/img/C8nnqbUegULfrJHYYfz1RygwQ_c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic696514.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Enclosure","Grid Movement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2006,"bggRating":5.94705,"averageRating":6.42021,"rank":2889,"designers":["Gaetano Evola","Rosanna Leocata"],"publishers":["Competo / Marektoy","Immortal Eyes Games","Venice Connection","Winning Moves Games (USA)"],"artists":["Michael Menzel"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":30,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":29,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":12,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":18,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":26,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
