The game comes with over 100 different Crew members, each with unique characteristics.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is divided into 2 main stages: Ship phase and landing on planets.&#10;&#10;During the Ship phase, players will manage their ship (binder with printed sleeves), where every section will have to make gameplay decisions. Then, you will prepare your crew for landing on the next planet, in search of answers to humanity's biggest questions. Together you will pick lander and customize it with modules, then each section will choose a crew member to take on a mission (more experienced crew members will have better ranks), build a skills deck, take equipment and choose dice for each character.&#10;&#10;During all phases of the games players will be directed to the Log-book, consisting story encounters, often written in the form of action-packed dialogues between the characters.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ySeZNVkVwTvqykMGtHFFQ__original/img/WMa7R2ViiGzzWpKWEdJAOv518PU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7245199.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ySeZNVkVwTvqykMGtHFFQ__thumb/img/pXp7JQo64YalithQyDM7tufyasA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7245199.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Open Drafting","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Storytelling","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":7.34384,"averageRating":8.6186,"rank":196,"designers":["Andrzej Betkiewicz","Krzysztof Piskorski","Paweł Samborski","Marcin Świerkot"],"publishers":["Awaken Realms","Delta Vision Publishing","MeepleBR","Pegasus Spiele","Ігромаг"],"artists":["Piotr Gacek","Patryk Jędraszek","Ewa Labak","Dominik Mayer"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":99,"recommended":64,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":109,"recommended":58,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":16,"recommended":77,"notRecommended":47,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":26,"recommended":62,"notRecommended":55,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":111,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
