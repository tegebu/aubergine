The more cards drafted, the less money earned to build floors of the houses. The player then pays to play up to three of their cards. When a three-story house is complete, a scoring card is added underneath the completed house.&#10;&#10;Tourist cards score points for things like the number of cats visible on the house, the number of potted plants, or other similar conditions. The resident cards will score points for larger areas, like for the number of pedestrians walking up and down the street; for the number of different shops along the canal; or other horizontal sections of the player's tableau.&#10;&#10;There are point penalties if houses are mismatched colors, if two neighboring houses are the same color, or if there are boarded up windows on a card.&#10;&#10;When a player completes all five houses in their section of Burano, the game ends after all players have had an equal number of turns. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BpG5IM1yz7NgYBnYLoe4mQ__original/img/_POyl0mZo8VCd5tiH7a_bOgxMXM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4810025.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BpG5IM1yz7NgYBnYLoe4mQ__thumb/img/Jjmrq82-qz2XO5FZFZkiUF7sBDo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4810025.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":6.35529,"averageRating":7.19313,"rank":1317,"designers":["Wei-Min Ling"],"publishers":["EmperorS4","Alderac Entertainment Group","Board Game Circus","Nasza KsiÄ™garnia","Tranjis Games"],"artists":["Maisherly"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":16,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":24,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":19,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":8,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
