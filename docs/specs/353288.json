{"gameId":353288,"name":"Trekking Through History","description":"We designed Trekking through History for gamers and non-gamers to play together. The goal was to make a game inviting for non-gamers, but with a little subtlety under the hood for gamers.&#10;&#10;In the game, you go on a three-day tour of human history, traveling thousands of years in a time machine to experience great moments from our past.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over three rounds, each representing one day of your trip. Each day, you visit a series of historical events, spending a different number of hours at each.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you choose to visit one historical event, and spend a certain number of hours doing it. Doing so will yield benefits, like checking off items on your itinerary for points, and earning Time Crystals so you can bend the space-time continuum on future turns.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll also score points for visiting historical events in chronological order.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v9mg1nwp7I6DBPveHSumPA__original/img/EMx7ANS4LvolbOXmwJh-wT0UXPQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7970728.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v9mg1nwp7I6DBPveHSumPA__thumb/img/tOJGm1XgsWhDP9BOiJHBfIxbOIA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7970728.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Open Drafting","Set Collection","Turn Order: Time Track"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.89609,"averageRating":7.65906,"rank":578,"designers":["Charlie Bink"],"publishers":["Underdog Games (I)","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Game Factory","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames","Lautapelit.fi","Lord of Boards","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","White Goblin Games"],"artists":["Eric Hibbeler"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":5,"recommended":44,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":28,"recommended":43,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":39,"recommended":29,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":18,"recommended":42,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":38,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
