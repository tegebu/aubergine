The old sea dog is surely planning an escape, after all, after which he will definitely try to get his treasure back.&#10;&#10;Treasure Island is a game of bluffing and adventure in which one player embodies Long John, trying to mislead the others in their search for his treasure. The hunt reaches its climax with Long John's escape, when he will make a final run to get the booty for himself!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_jRH6vLRmKoVDtTJoUtZaA__original/img/yzu_wy2ukpTrSLZ7RbyexQV5Ukk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3895468.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_jRH6vLRmKoVDtTJoUtZaA__thumb/img/yRbs2hjxsUAbgk2Dkju7pYdZnLY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3895468.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Deduction","Hand Management","Line Drawing","Measurement Movement","Secret Unit Deployment","Semi-Cooperative Game","Storytelling","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":6.78317,"averageRating":7.27842,"rank":642,"designers":["Marc Paquien"],"publishers":["Matagot","Conclave Editora","Gen-X Games","Hobby World","Mancalamaro","Mandoo Games","Pegasus Spiele","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Surfin' Meeple China"],"artists":["Vincent Dutrait"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":51,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":16,"notRecommended":39,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":12,"recommended":35,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":45,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":27,"recommended":27,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":32,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
