{"gameId":41916,"name":"The Magic Labyrinth","description":"The little magician apprentices have lost some magic objects inside of the master&rsquo;s maze. Now they try to collect them before the Master notices anything. However, in the maze there are invisible walls and only one of the missing objects is revealed at a time. So they have to make their way through the maze by means of a good memory and lots of skill.&#10;&#10;Each player moves their magician over the board while trying not to bump the labyrinth below. Each magician is joined with a magnetic ball so if you hit a wall the ball drops and you have to start all over again.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pxaH7_Vihsg-nJBsXLvCRA__original/img/aELxAoP908IOGflnALCRSaU16CU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic953186.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pxaH7_Vihsg-nJBsXLvCRA__thumb/img/MoLZ7glHk6EEbGQSHauFLJIqFl4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic953186.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Memory","Network and Route Building","Roll / Spin and Move"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2009,"bggRating":6.45063,"averageRating":6.81932,"rank":1265,"designers":["Dirk Baumann"],"publishers":["Drei Magier Spiele","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)","Brädspel.se","Competo / Marektoy","Devir","G3","Gigamic","HaKubia","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Lautapelit.fi","Lion Rampant Imports","Playgo Hungary","Playroom Entertainment","Spilbræt.dk","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Vennerød Forlag AS"],"artists":["Rolf Vogt"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":31,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":12,"recommended":37,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":27,"recommended":16,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":40,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":30,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
