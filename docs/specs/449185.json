{"gameId":449185,"name":"FlipToons","description":"It&rsquo;s time to cast the next great animated show! A top talent agent like you knows a star when you see one, and the director needs you to fill six roles for the big production. Search Flip Valley for the perfect toon characters, and make sure they&rsquo;re ready to work together on the silver screen!&#10;&#10;FlipToons is a quick deck-building game for 1-4 players. You&rsquo;ll begin with a deck of hopeful toon actors. Each round, flip six of these toons out from your deck into your screen grid to audition together.&#10;&#10;Each toon card in your 3-by-2 grid has different talent effects. Some are resolved as soon as they are flipped. Many will interact with one another and (hopefully) earn Fame for your studio. But they won&rsquo;t all have that special on-screen chemistry you&rsquo;re looking for. Some won&rsquo;t work well together at all!&#10;&#10;After each Flip, tally up your current grid of toons&rsquo; Fame points, then spend them to hire more stars for your cast. Purchase these new toon cards from the market and add them to your deck. Or, spend some of your Fame to dismiss a card, and get that bad actor off the stage. Sorry kid, you just don&rsquo;t have what it takes to be a star in this show.&#10;&#10;If your Flip is the first to generate 30+ Fame, you&rsquo;ll earn the Critic&rsquo;s Choice award (worth extra Fame points) and trigger the end of the game. After that turn&rsquo;s market phase, it&rsquo;s time for one Final Flip. The player who earns the most Fame during the Final Flip is declared the winner. Applause!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EEcBICSVGbH0Epy_LKpiVw__original/img/oC3sW6J1iWaZfr1mOEjVy7dF1IY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8964384.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EEcBICSVGbH0Epy_LKpiVw__thumb/img/5pAE-HkT5IxtknnDq1oD5SRLJeQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8964384.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Market","Open Drafting","Score-and-Reset Game","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.2619,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jordy Adan","Renato Simões"],"publishers":["Thunderworks Games (TW Games)","Geeks N' Orcs"],"artists":["Diego Sá"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
