Here, you are one of those same architects, tasked with various requirements and requests of pharaoh. Score points by taking on pharaoh's demands and placing pieces freely in an organic, creative space. However, your opponents are trying to gain favor of their own, and soon all your competing needs will clash as you meld and transform the desert into a timeless place of holy worship. Add in some tricky methods of moving your opponents pieces and freezing your own in place, and you will be an ancient architect in no time!&#10;&#10;This competitive game is steeped in lovely art and historical references to try and bring one of the world's oldest, and most renovated, creations to life.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7T9_m0wENiHD3dK5NRGprA__original/img/ISsBvSM0GlTtzXIpPmuOOQZEXoQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8526456.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7T9_m0wENiHD3dK5NRGprA__thumb/img/EwhmuCEwexPKzYSNf6Tq-zk1Tmo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8526456.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":25,"mechanics":["Contracts","Stacking and Balancing"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.76923,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jasper Beatrix"],"publishers":["DVC Games"],"artists":["Imane Moussaid"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
