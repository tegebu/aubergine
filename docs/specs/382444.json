{"gameId":382444,"name":"Fled","description":"Ireland's potato famine left you leaner than a four-line limerick! Even worse, it drove you to petty theft. Soon, you find yourself within the walls of Spike Island prison &mdash; shackled and shoeless. These days, the warders whistle you to the yard, the wash room, and your bunk, but there's only one place you want to be: gone, vanished...fled!&#10;&#10;The object of Fled is to score the most victory points (VP) while trying to escape from prison. Throughout the game, you will manage a hand of tiles. Each turn, you add a tile to the prison, then discard other tiles to move from room to room while collecting contraband. Some rooms, like the Warder's Quarters, allow you to trade your contraband for the tools you'll need to get past the outer wall.
