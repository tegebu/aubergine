{"gameId":317457,"name":"Dinosaur World","description":"The triumph of science that led to dinosaurs returning to the world once more has become public knowledge. New parks spring up regularly, often beginning operations even before everything has been finalized. There is no shortage of patrons eager to be entertained by these returned species in new and exciting ways. However, as with any form of entertainment, elements of triumph are often accompanied by elements of tragedy. This means it is of the utmost importance that you take every precaution by ensuring each visitor signs the safety waiver before enjoying the wonders of Dinosaur World!&#10;&#10;Each round in Dinosaur World, you draft a new r&eacute;sum&eacute; card to acquire new workers; spend workers to take public actions building your park and acquiring DNA; spend further workers to take private actions improving that park; then drive your jeep around experiencing the wonder and excitement of what you have built! Throughout the game you acquire victory points through a variety of means &mdash; and possibly a few visitor deaths as a natural consequence of overly enthusiastic dinosaur encounters. At the end of the game, you lose points if you accumulated too many deaths, then the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-CvtJOYWZQDw1tuOdDd4Q__original/img/Eo6IIIYE_Ks1AkMS7garjfSXsh4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6020854.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-CvtJOYWZQDw1tuOdDd4Q__thumb/img/JmOmFgjBhY0rc1ejk7z7Cw1o9Dw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6020854.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Income","Movement Points","Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.66602,"averageRating":7.38411,"rank":918,"designers":["Brian Lewis","David McGregor","Marissa Misura"],"publishers":["Pandasaurus Games","La Boîte de Jeu","Devir","Fearless Frog","Galakta"],"artists":["Kwanchai Moriya","Joe Shawcross","Andrew Thompson"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":7,"recommended":21,"notRecommended":22,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":27,"recommended":37,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":34,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":15,"recommended":27,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":40,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
