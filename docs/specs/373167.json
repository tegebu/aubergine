{"gameId":373167,"name":"20 Strong","description":"20 Strong is a new deck-based game system from Chip Theory Games, capable of being played in about 30 minutes or less. We say &ldquo;game system&rdquo; because the idea behind 20 Strong is a small nucleus of simple, adaptable rules that can then be applied to a variety of unique decks, each with their own set of mechanics. We are launching 20 Strong with three such decks &ndash; one set in the world of Too Many Bones, one set in Hoplomachus: Victorum, and one in the new universe of the space-faring Solar Sentinels. We have more decks in development and plan to release them regularly if our customers are excited by them. For now, 20 Strong is a solo-only game, but even that could differ in future decks using the ruleset.&#10;&#10;The object of a game of 20 Strong is to progress through a shuffled deck of cards, each card bearing a unique challenge. This challenge could be in the form of an enemy, a unique scenario, or some other requirement (for example, players of the Too Many Bones deck might expect to see a Lockpicking challenge or two). Challenges usually require a certain number of successes to complete, which you earn by rolling a set of 17 dice with different odds for a hit (these dice, along with three adjustable stat dice, make up the &ldquo;20&rdquo; in 20 Strong).&#10;&#10;If you roll enough successes, you complete a card&rsquo;s challenge and gain its rewards. If you don&rsquo;t, you take damage and move on to the next card &ndash; unless, of course, your HP stat is reduced to 0, costing you the game. If you manage to make it through an entire deck, you take on one of the deck&rsquo;s final bosses, attempting to score enough hits against this powerful enemy to claim ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Of course, it&rsquo;s never so easy that you&rsquo;d want to spend all of your dice on a single card. In addition to your HP Stat, you&rsquo;re also keeping track of your Strategy (which controls how many rerolls and items you have) and your Recovery, which controls how many dice return to your pool after taking on a challenge. If you roll more dice than your Recovery, those dice are exhausted, lowering your pool for your subsequent challenges. It&rsquo;s a game of pressing your luck, strategic decision-making, and resource management. We think you&rsquo;re going to love it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ofw86iJ36-IOhMNdiRZd3w__original/img/tpTaYLFrgmnN4m92zEym4ywANyk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7720772.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ofw86iJ36-IOhMNdiRZd3w__thumb/img/OkVkzjA9oyQupxvJympa5ODBdrQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7720772.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Move Through Deck","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.28685,"averageRating":7.54972,"rank":1736,"designers":["Josh J.
