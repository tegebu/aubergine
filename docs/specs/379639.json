{"gameId":379639,"name":"Secrets in the Sand","description":"The Department of Antiquities has uncovered evidence of a series of lost tombs. They have invited you, the world&rsquo;s leading archaeologists, to help find the lost tombs and recover their treasures.&#10;&#10;Each day the Minister of Antiquities will announce one new dig permit, and the first expedition to find a viable route is allowed to travel and dig. Race against competing archaeological expeditions across desert sands, through jungle oases and across rivers to find the tombs. But beware of scorpions, raiders and sandstorms along the way!&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tombs are discovered or an expedition runs out of dig camps - whichever occurs first. Either way, the player with the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KjCd1zVJhH3iPjUwj2xthQ__original/img/oeL7z_i3QOU8HgjlfL5jo2hvJ_8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7324155.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KjCd1zVJhH3iPjUwj2xthQ__thumb/img/4MGohuHikTrZ1e7lAkWw_-O-spw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7324155.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Command Cards","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Network and Route Building","Point to Point Movement","Race","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":[],"publishers":["Canterville Games"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
