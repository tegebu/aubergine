{"gameId":440942,"name":"Trismegistus: New Edition","description":"In the 19th century, alchemy was regarded as an occult science&mdash;a blend of modern discoveries and ancient wisdom. Though the golden age of alchemy has long passed, the dream of bending the laws of nature and creating the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone remains alive. A new generation now walks in the footsteps of the legendary Hermes Trismegistus, seeking forbidden knowledge and craving power. Their imagination and resolve are unrivaled. Some view them with fear; others, with awe and admiration. As you take your first steps into the world of alchemy, your goal is to uncover the mysteries hidden since the dawn of time and outshine all others in the quest to become the greatest alchemist the world has ever known.&#10;&#10;In Trismegistus, players take on the role of 19th-century researchers who have discovered Trismegistus' notes and attempt to follow his formula for creating the Philosopher's Stone. Over the course of three rounds &mdash; representing the years of their doctoral studies &mdash; they will perform various experiments, gaining and transmuting metals with the aid of mysterious artifacts. At the end of the game, players are awarded points based on their published research and their knowledge of the primal elements, as well as their progress toward creating the Philosopher's Stone itself.&#10;&#10;The new edition features a more accessible and less complex set of game mechanics.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mIbh2CK5zEYzJk5S0UomGg__original/img/WtEkmykyih_GfmCSsLO7_vNhu9E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8898514.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mIbh2CK5zEYzJk5S0UomGg__thumb/img/GSrC-qK70ssasb4pSl35uJh45Hw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8898514.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Action Points","Contracts","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Pass Order","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.45278,"rank":-1,"designers":["Federico Pierlorenzi","Daniele Tascini"],"publishers":["Board&Dice"],"artists":["Katarzyna Bekus","Anna \"Mikado\" Przybylska","Kate \"vesner\" Redesiuk","Wiktor Kozyra"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
