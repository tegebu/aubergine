{"gameId":378926,"name":"Theme Park Mania","description":"Together all 2 - 4 players contribute to build the greatest theme park ever. During the first phase of the game all players build the layout of the park with paths and railroad tracks to earn cash.&#10;&#10;With the cash earned, each player can buy rides and facilities to connect them to the theme park layout. You also need team members to build, operate and secure your rides and facilities.&#10;&#10;When 4 rides are build, the park will open the gates for your guests. During the second phase of the game, you'll need to walk the board and visit all rides by playing move- and action cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to visit all rides will end the game directly. No further moves or turns allowed. Time to count each players victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X6-BJa0D52795d1INb7aOw__original/img/uY6uyxJT21H4IKNcoLjgpVcWqXg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7732340.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X6-BJa0D52795d1INb7aOw__thumb/img/MKGyR3aVUPLmWH4z9Wt_pxYC-w4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7732340.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Command Cards","Modular Board","Network and Route Building","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Pass Order","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":5.10714,"rank":-1,"designers":["Gertjan Ekkel","Susan Ekkel"],"publishers":["Meeple Master"],"artists":["Gertjan Ekkel"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
