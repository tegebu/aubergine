{"gameId":338326,"name":"Clash of Galliformes","description":"On Kickstarter June 15th (2022)&#10;&#10;Explore, build and battle in this strategy and resource management game with ground-living birds set in an alternate timeline where birds work alongside tribal clans. As the clans have developed close to their feathery mounts, their cultures have been formed by their specific clan birds. Some have mastered the way of faster bird breeding while others have gone down a more warlike path. Now is the time to choose your bird and in so doing, your way of life.&#10;&#10;Players must expand their territory to find supplies and new technologies for their tribes. The threat from rival clans is also constant, so you have to adapt your strategies and think ahead of your opponents to survive. Will you conquer the other clans by force or will your memory live on through the peaceful measure of completing cave paintings? The choice is yours!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7rBMTk7b6Mrvuc9ZEOrMKw__original/img/abX_QAoqwIRgyRm5daX1FsRTxSA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6878001.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7rBMTk7b6Mrvuc9ZEOrMKw__thumb/img/fMQikfpAJjhntYwOQ7dfBSYIeUI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6878001.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Movement","Map Addition","Modular Board","Multiple Maps","Player Elimination","Point to Point Movement","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Kim Ã…berg","Kim Jansson"],"publishers":["Todys Games"],"artists":["Kim Jansson"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
