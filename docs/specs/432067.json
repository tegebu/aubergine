{"gameId":432067,"name":"Assyria: Second Edition","description":"Before uniting to become one of history's great empires, the ancient Assyrian people expanded as smaller nomadic tribes along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Here they fished, farmed, and flourished, despite the lingering threat of flooding. They claimed new land, constructed great ziggurats, and cultivated their influence with surrounding civilizations. Now it's time to bring your offerings and gather your gold! May your feet find favor wherever they go.&#10;&#10;The aim of Assyria is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. You gain points primarily by building huts and ziggurats, making offerings, and increasing your influence. Each round, players bid for turn order, expand on the map, and take various actions. After the third and sixth rounds, a flood will occur, wiping away everything along the two rivers. After the final flood, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;This second edition of Assyria is a redeveloped and redesigned edition of the 2009 release Assyria from Italian designer, Emanuele Ornella.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3d9Fr_C3A6PYvLX83Zoyng__original/img/utXvKA_1TPJOvNSEh0rLU_IKr8I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8516109.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3d9Fr_C3A6PYvLX83Zoyng__thumb/img/avGVhbQKm9CYjdpF-3gWQH7_0nk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8516109.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Hexagon Grid","Multi-Use Cards","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Turn Order: Auction"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":4.33333,"rank":-1,"designers":["S J Macdonald","Emanuele Ornella","Shem Phillips"],"publishers":["Garphill Games"],"artists":["Sam Phillips"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
