{"gameId":373009,"name":"Oh Crab!","description":"Unique crab-themed board game for families and gamers alike! An original combination of mechanics, strategic depth, and interaction.&#10;&#10;Race to safety in the sea! With a modular two-sided board, each game is a new challenge. Build your deck wisely to outsmart the others!&#10;&#10;You can follow the game here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartflamingo/oh-crab &#10;The campaign on KS starts on 20th June 2024, 5:30 PM CET - Warsaw time&#10;&#10;&#10;In the game 'Oh, Crab!', players take on the role of crabs that have escaped from the fry-house and run away along the beach to hide in the safe waves of the sea. On their way they will face various obstacles like sandcastles, rubbish, voracious gulls and other crabs clumsily making their way towards the water.&#10;&#10;Players move their crabs across a modular board by playing one card from their hand face down each round, and then performing actions and moves from it on their turn. Cards played on following rounds can be chained by matching the halves of the icons on the sides, allowing for even more moves or gaining shells that can be spent on special actions.&#10;&#10;When crabs move or are pushed into the obstacles on the board, players will need to discard the cards from their hands, forcing them to spend a turn to rest. When resting, players retrieve all their cards back, and gain one new card, with additional special actions and more options for chaining.&#10;&#10;The first crab to get into safe waters of the sea wins the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8PKlgmMUV_mpglsXcQGhTA__original/img/xpO_4eTa4b1ofrC4GIduQmnke2U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7738214.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8PKlgmMUV_mpglsXcQGhTA__thumb/img/GPR1lzsJusxQRoOK9tve-yBaHNw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7738214.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Chaining","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Modular Board","Race","Simultaneous Action Selection","Take That"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.49889,"rank":-1,"designers":["Bartosz Szopka","Bartłomiej Zielonka"],"publishers":["Smart Flamingo"],"artists":["Radosław Jaszczuk"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
