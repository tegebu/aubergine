{"gameId":275912,"name":"Rise & Fall","description":"Rise &amp; Fall is a full control strategic game. Each player controls a civilization trying to expand and progress in a fantasy world. This world displays a unique landscape where glaciers live on islands and huge cliffs are common barriers and challenges to overcome.&#10;&#10;In this gorgeous land each player starts with a small tribe including a village, a citizen and a ship and will grow to a full civilization with more of the pre-mentioned units but also temples, merchants and the precious highlanders, the only ones able to pass those astonishing cliffs.&#10;&#10;Rise &amp; Fall is a very immersive and addictive game, easy to understand, with no luck or randomness involved. The initial creation of the world by itself is a real pleasure and each game brings a different map to the table.&#10;&#10;The new players will enjoy the game for its &ldquo;easy access&rdquo; aspect. Since all the actions you can do are displayed on the six cards of a player&rsquo;s deck, this makes the game really accessible right from the start.&#10;&#10;The more exigent strategist players will love the game for its full control aspect and the fact that the learning curve seems to be a constant line of progression.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rFIIcIxyOKShug4-GQvWYw__original/img/v6AcoJuJVpz1sLQhqCfdoLp5c5w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4972241.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rFIIcIxyOKShug4-GQvWYw__thumb/img/SjJH0qWkDwzbiwBTZ0NVRzYhUgs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4972241.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":80,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.185,"rank":-1,"designers":["Christophe Boelinger"],"publishers":["Ludically"],"artists":["Guillaume BeauchÃªne","Dogan Oztel","Guillaume Tavernier","Sabrina Tobal"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
