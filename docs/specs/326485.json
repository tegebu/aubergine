{"gameId":326485,"name":"Cthulhu Wars: Duel","description":"The Old Ones have risen. Monsters walk the Earth. Humanity is finished, but the struggle continues. Which Great Old One will rule the ruins of Earth? Now, you take charge!&#10;&#10;Cthulhu Wars: Duel is a fast-moving two-player strategy game in which you play as Great Cthulhu himself or the Black Goat, a cosmic goddess of hideous fertility. Each side is strikingly different with unique units, abilities, and strategies available.&#10;&#10;In Cthulhu Wars: Duel, the giant plastic miniatures have been replaced with cardboard standees. This not only allows the game to be more affordable, but also makes it travel friendly and saves table space. This means you can drop a box of Cthulhu Wars: Duel in a bag and take it to your game night with minimal space requirements. Cthulhu Wars: Duel also doesn't take up as much table space as the original, allowing it to be played in smaller spaces. In short, this is the most accessible version of Cthulhu wars ever made!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjU2k13xe4OFYYO6cSWhzg__original/img/5-aF2P3jPrRoa-BnBr-YwepkwbU=/0x0/pic5844629.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjU2k13xe4OFYYO6cSWhzg__thumb/img/UmRUtYnyPDqPLh0Vw4RMiqlWaIk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5844629.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.5,"rank":-1,"designers":["Sandy Petersen"],"publishers":["Petersen Games"],"artists":["Graey Erb","Richard Luong","Damien Mammoliti"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
