It can be played completely in your hand, but I provide a way to play it on-table as well.&#10;&#10;REGARDING SPOILERS: If you haven't played Gloomhaven, you won't be spoiled on much with Gloomholdin'. You'll see the the names and art for a number of monsters and items from Gloomhaven, but that's about it.
