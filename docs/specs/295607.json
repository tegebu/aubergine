{"gameId":295607,"name":"Canopy","description":"Canopy is a game in which two players compete to grow the most bountiful rainforest. The jungle ecosystem is full of symbiosis and mutualism, and players must grow tall trees and lush jungle plants to attract the most diverse wildlife. By carefully selecting what grows in your forest, you can create the ideal balance of flora and fauna and develop a thriving rainforest.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take turns selecting new cards for their forest from three growth piles. Each time you look at a pile, you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face down, adding one additional card to it. As the piles grow, you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most &mdash; but choose carefully as the jungle also contains dangers in the form or fire, disease, and drought.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-zWPMAXd1IZllCMAP5IeVA__original/img/vk0v34dLBl4utcZV-Kqc3QXVIUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5090694.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-zWPMAXd1IZllCMAP5IeVA__thumb/img/qkimPPOS3fMxvXDtXZvPemc-Lvc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5090694.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Open Drafting","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.52189,"averageRating":7.42701,"rank":1127,"designers":["Tim Eisner"],"publishers":["Weird City Games","Devir","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","Hobby Game Mall","Hobby World","KOSMOS","Lucky Duck Games","Meeples","MINDOK"],"artists":["Vincent Dutrait"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":17,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":46,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":20,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
