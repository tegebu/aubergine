With a huge shopping culture, Edo's main district, Nihonbashi, was lined with shops, selling kimonos, rice, and so much more.&#10;&#10;Nihonbashi is the focus of IKI: A Game of EDO Artisans, which brings you on a journey through the famed street of old Tokyo. Hear the voices of Nihonbashi Bridge's great fish market. Meet the professionals, who carry out 700&shy;-800 different jobs. Enter the interactivity of the shoppers and vendors. Become one with the townspeople.&#10;&#10;One of the main professions in the world of Edo is the artisan. Each of the Edo artisans uses their own skill of trade to support the townspeople's lives. In this game, not only are there artisans, but street vendors, sellers at the shops, and professions unique to this time and age. Meet the puppet masters, putting on a show. Meet the ear cleaners that people would line up for.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to become the annual Edoite, best personifying what is known as &quot;IKI&quot;, an ancient philosophy believed to be the ideal way of living among people in Edo.
