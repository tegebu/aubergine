{"gameId":316090,"name":"Vivid Memories","description":"Every stick is a sword. Every bike is a steed. Every memory is a possibility.&#10;&#10;Vivid Memories is a drafting game of building a network of connected memories formed by threads of colored tokens. With a touch of engine-building and a lot of character, this completely language-independent experience invokes the wonder of childhood memories with immersive art and fluid, deceptively simple gameplay that creates big moments and satisfying payoffs.&#10;&#10;During the game, players take turns collecting fragments of childhood memories, weaving a tapestry of colored threads in their mind. By cleverly creating connections, players are rewarded for how they store memory fragments while working toward completing &ldquo;core memories&rdquo;, which give repeated benefits each round. Through their journey, players store important moments in their memory bank -- choosing to remember the moment as it happened, gaining new abilities, or as it was imagined, giving new opportunities to score -- all while working to meet the objective of what they aspire to be when they grow up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-KMXyStWyla5jh_BRO803w__original/img/8aU1fwVWDMrBGVBJCq3t8mLLPOA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6074555.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-KMXyStWyla5jh_BRO803w__thumb/img/3j7TG-J5bxigP1RaTbNnHcHnr6A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6074555.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Drafting","Network and Route Building"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.27273,"rank":-1,"designers":["Matthew Dunstan","Brett J.
