{"gameId":367833,"name":"Forges of Ravenshire","description":"Grab a hammer and some steel, it&rsquo;s time to forge! The Blacksmiths Guild of Ravenshire is in need of a new Forgemaster. You and your fellow smiths are competing to see who can make the most money and become the new Forgemaster.&#10;&#10;Forges of Ravenshire is played over 4 seasons or rounds. Each season starts with the gathering phase where players will acquire contracts, recruit guild members, and gather resources. Players roll their dice workers and place one of them on an available location to gather resources. Then retrieve a different dice worker to gather even more resources. However, the various workers are from different guilds and when retrieved will activate the guilds you have invested in. All players will take turns placing one of their workers and retrieving another worker 3 times.&#10;&#10;After the gathering phase is the production phase. Take those 3 dice workers you have taken and now place them on different areas of your forge to gather more resources, make charcoal or steel, and forge contracts to make money.&#10;&#10;At the end of every season, check to see if any special titles have been earned. Titles bring prestige and hard-earned money.&#10;&#10;Finally, roll your 3 dice workers again and prepare the town of Ravenshire for the next season.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/h_Itp1hAGIrlVL_Zpi-pjw__original/img/RL96WLwJN_lTxleJp2PHSC7Zzmk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7020447.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/h_Itp1hAGIrlVL_Zpi-pjw__thumb/img/hBxUC65QsOoNWCWGs8C11vfShAg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7020447.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":100,"mechanics":["Contracts","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Progressive","Victory Points as a Resource","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.73333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Sam Stockton"],"publishers":["B.A. Games"],"artists":["Liam Peters","Andrea Radeck"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
