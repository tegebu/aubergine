{"gameId":270956,"name":"The Court of Miracles","description":"In The Court of Miracles, lead a guild of beggars, plot, use trickery and opportunism to build your renown and take over the old 16th century Paris.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to establish your renown in Paris or to be the most influential when the Penniless King would have reached the end of his path...&#10;&#10;At your turn, you may play a plot card, you have to place one of your (3) Rogue tokens, face down (secret ability), on any available spot in a neighborhood, and benefit from the effect of your spot (receive coins, draw plot cards or move  the Penniless King forward along his path). You may then perform the action of the neighborhood.&#10;&#10;When a neighborhood is fully occupied, settle a standoff revealing each player's Rogue(s) token to know which player takes control of the neighborhood. Controlling a neighborhood will reward you each time another player performs its action.&#10;&#10;You will be allowed to buy a 4th Rogue, cards or move the Penniless King Forward at the Renown Square.&#10;&#10;Unless the Penniless King reaches the last space of his path before, the first player to place their 6th Renown token wins. Otherwise, the player with the most Renown tokens placed on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pKYyeNMJi9OEcrd0ktbLGA__original/img/-wZ5vZzzm783O5d5blwfya481aQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5604048.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pKYyeNMJi9OEcrd0ktbLGA__thumb/img/9LOvvubpqBacdrCvOCCj-zxeSFI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5604048.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Secret Unit Deployment","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":5.82374,"averageRating":7.04625,"rank":3722,"designers":["Vincent Brugeas","Guilhem Gautrand"],"publishers":["Lumberjacks Studio","BoardM Factory","Evrikus","Lucky Duck Games"],"artists":["Ronan Toulhoat"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
