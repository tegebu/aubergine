{"gameId":229855,"name":"Bloodstone","description":"The Bloodstone is an evil and powerful relic that enchants any who possess it. We pick up our story with an interesting cast of characters from all over the realm. They all have very different stories about how they became entrapped in the arena. Nightly, they fight to the death only to be resurrected and made to do it all over again at the sorceress' whim.&#10;&#10;In Bloodstone, you control one of the characters and use a custom dice mechanism to determine your attacks and movements, using your miniature to move around the arena and engage in combat. You hope someday to escape this damned place, but tonight...you fight!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yY8pfa8BF3ggIBjVATTYXw__original/img/Cj9jPLticYH98ZIhTGWKIKtFue0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5756771.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yY8pfa8BF3ggIBjVATTYXw__thumb/img/g18qd2bTgDsXhlxuw37l7fCrrHQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5756771.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Player Elimination"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":0,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.57143,"rank":-1,"designers":["James Hudson"],"publishers":["Druid City Games"],"artists":["David Kegg","Matt Paquette"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
