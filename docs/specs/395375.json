The game is coming to retail in November.&#10;&#10;In Art Society, you are an art connoisseur trying to impress your peers by putting together the most fashionable art collection of them all! &#10;Bid on the hottest works of art, then arrange them on your drawing room wall into a tastefully curated gallery that&rsquo;s the envy of the local art scene.&#10;&#10;But beware!
