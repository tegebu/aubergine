Replace aging Manhattan and Berlin subway systems with newer, faster, quieter technology. Enhance your rail system's abilities so that your passengers arrive at their destinations first.&#10;&#10;Efficiency is your key to success in this pick-up-and-deliver, tile-laying, engine-building game. Transparent tiles allow your route to overlap your opponents' tracks, winding you along from station to station. Robots efficiently upgrade and adjust your abilities, leveraging unique goals to maximize points. By the end of the game, the game board has morphed into a modern subway map, with brightly-colored routes connecting stations all over the city.&#10;&#10;Maglev Metro contains two unique maps.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yCj3DQLmxwdSCjXlt-styQ__original/img/hP9rjkPFC2ePsxCMwM2PqW54xHI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5275652.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yCj3DQLmxwdSCjXlt-styQ__thumb/img/VlU8eNskscg8lSXPSVSv0anZ66c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5275652.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Network and Route Building","Pick-up and Deliver","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.20148,"averageRating":7.28673,"rank":1796,"designers":["Ted Alspach"],"publishers":["BÃ©zier Games","Maldito Games","Rawstone"],"artists":["Alanna Kelsey","Ollin Timm"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":14,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":11,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
