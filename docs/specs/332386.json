{"gameId":332386,"name":"Brew","description":"Bring balance back to the forest!&#10;&#10;Time is broken and shattered. The seasons all exist at once, and day and night have no real cycle &mdash; they rotate at the whim of the forest. This enchanted land has been driven into chaos and it's up to you, the cunning mystics of the forest, to tame extraordinary woodland creatures and use your magic to bring back balance.&#10;&#10;In Brew, players must choose how to use element dice, either to take back control of as many seasons as possible in an area-control game or to procure goods at the local village in a worker-placement game. Recruiting woodland creatures and brewing potions can help offset chance die-rolls or create an engine to help you tame the lands.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8eN5t1p4ncee-eVN9NswDA__original/img/Hhv8kruqZZH1vv5W7gR7QXNZ_KM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6007253.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8eN5t1p4ncee-eVN9NswDA__thumb/img/EI64n63DbQ9DHhTf72s7UpUFMBY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6007253.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Card Drafting","Dice Rolling","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.52387,"averageRating":7.20312,"rank":13326,"designers":["Stevo Torres"],"publishers":["Pandasaurus Games"],"artists":["Jake Morrison","Andrew Thompson"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
