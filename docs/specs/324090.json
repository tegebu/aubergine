{"gameId":324090,"name":"Scarface 1920","description":"&ldquo;You can go a long way with a smile. You can go a lot further with a smile and a gun.&rdquo; -Al Capone&#10;&#10;Chicago in the Roaring 20s. Prohibition has made liquor business illegal and now criminal gangs operate in the underworld to try and take control of the city. Blood, influence, power, and money add up to a dangerous mix on the streets.&#10;&#10;In Scarface 1920 you will lead a gang of mobsters aiming to rule Chicago during the Dry Era (1920-33). To succeed you will have to rule every inch in gangland, expand your racketeering, run bootlegging operations, bribe the city officials, and make sure the coppers are on your side.&#10;&#10;Scarface 1920 blends worker placement with deck-building mechanics in a game where you will have to recruit new associates, break new deals, fill the streets of Chicago with your thugs, enhance your headquarters &mdash;and do some dirty jobs along the way.&#10;&#10;Every gang has a distinct set of abilities embodied in their boss, and in every game you will be able to choose a different path to victory. However, in this turf war you will have to confront other rival gangs that share an identical goal: growing their criminal empire. But they are not the only challenge you will face &mdash;Eliot Ness and his Feds are out to get you too!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b0HXxXK40QsTwSxynD2DDA__original/img/ZgJTGjdDj2CkmYUxNklvYC9q2Yc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5926553.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b0HXxXK40QsTwSxynD2DDA__thumb/img/dPCm4RXyLyc4kz1m15R5fbko8jM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5926553.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.29825,"averageRating":8.12904,"rank":1621,"designers":["Toni Serradesanferm","Daniel Simon"],"publishers":["Redzen Games","Grimspire","SD Games","Spiele-Offensive.de"],"artists":["Antonio Stappaerts"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":5,"recommended":17,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":6,"recommended":30,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":40,"recommended":18,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":26,"recommended":25,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":25,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
