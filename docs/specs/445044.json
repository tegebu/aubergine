What are they? Oh, the wisps from the old tales! Each one sparkles with charm and mischief, carrying a unique personality. Can you guide them just right and make your forest the brightest?&#10;&#10;Welcome to Wispwood, a magical place populated by glowing wisps. On your turn, choose a wisp tile and a shape to place in your personal grid &mdash; your very own growing forest.

Between rounds, the forest shifts &mdash; fading and expanding &mdash; yet the wisps you've already placed remain, shaping the possibilities ahead.&#10;&#10;With each game, new goal cards redefine the wisps' whims, ensuring your forest grows in a unique way every time. Enter the forest and explore the magic of Wispwood!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OymEgib8Sh3Mhup64pJX-A__original/img/pIvle5n77Ysb9_9Bzjwtguq1QHE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8857307.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OymEgib8Sh3Mhup64pJX-A__thumb/img/wXH1XB5k_jQ8-oZdkcaSbdVzcjo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8857307.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Grid Coverage","Open Drafting","Pattern Building","Score-and-Reset Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Square Grid","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.28,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reed Ambrose"],"publishers":["Czech Games Edition (CGE)"],"artists":["Štěpán Drašťák"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
