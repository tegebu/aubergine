Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points.  To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill.  Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cubetower plays the leading role.  The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately.  Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied.  Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes &ndash; SHOGUN!&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Wallenstein&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__original/img/5jtGQuMBFhnJJI119hAYGqVDy3Y=/0x0/pic3336315.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__thumb/img/BcVo6uokndgMSoFdIdEmgu-2C1o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3336315.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Auction/Bidding","Cube Tower","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Phase Order"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2006,"bggRating":7.28953,"averageRating":7.54218,"rank":186,"designers":["Dirk Henn"],"publishers":["Queen Games","Bergsala Enigma","G3","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","M-√Ågnes","Rebel Sp. z o.o."],"artists":["Michael Menzel"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":135,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":130,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":20,"recommended":120,"notRecommended":64,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":117,"recommended":104,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":165,"recommended":53,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":94,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
