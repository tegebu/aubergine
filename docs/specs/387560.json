{"gameId":387560,"name":"Perch","description":"In Perch, players fight for control of locations by commanding birds of their own and other players' flocks. Earn points and command woodland creatures by having the most birds on a location, pushing your foes off the perch, and breaking ties to take the lead.&#10;&#10;Each round, players add their birds into a shared bag. Players then draw birds of their own, and other players take turns stacking birds on location tiles. Each location tile will award variable points for majorities and sometimes grant players a unique ability.  The game ends after five rounds, and the player who has earned the most points wins.&#10;&#10;With a modular tile configuration and a variety of woodland creatures to control, each game will present a new tactical challenge.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1t6J2QHaLMjmomBnHrtwxA__original/img/zflqo95w09oO07RgVmS-CmTDnLQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7558885.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1t6J2QHaLMjmomBnHrtwxA__thumb/img/wr9PCDczDC32135gaLxTOILZPds=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7558885.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","King of the Hill","Modular Board","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.33333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Douglas Hettrick"],"publishers":["Inside Up Games","Skellig Games"],"artists":["Ari Oliver"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
