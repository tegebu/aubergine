{"gameId":414117,"name":"Wroth","description":"Wroth is an area control board game that can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo.&#10;&#10;Players choose a faction and vie for control of the island of Wroth by drafting action dice to gain resources, deploying and moving troops, and attacking the opposition - all while trying to hold key positions and dominate the region. Wroth rewards cunning troop management and the clever use of your faction&rsquo;s elite troops and powerful once-per-game abilities. Each faction has asymmetric abilities so what works for one won't necessarily work for another.&#10;&#10;The game ends after a round when one faction reaches 30 victory points or completes a scenario-based mission, depending on the game mode.&#10;&#10;Wroth can be taught in 10-15 minutes, and is playable in roughly an hour.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UHr-f2LWrsMth2-VpWAq1w__original/img/PMLI1TJghdRLr1N841uQBIR_J1g=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8934142.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UHr-f2LWrsMth2-VpWAq1w__thumb/img/cya4y0uzC5oUi-FmRqVIVDQKfyM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8934142.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Area Majority / Influence","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Die Icon Resolution","Moving Multiple Units","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.70757,"averageRating":7.77882,"rank":5885,"designers":["Manny Trembley"],"publishers":["Chip Theory Games","Fox in the Box","Frosted Games","HIT Games"],"artists":["Manny Trembley"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":7,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":7,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":11,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
