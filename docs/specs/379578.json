The Fantasies &amp; Futures expansion gives players the opportunity to build civilizations using fantasy and sci-fi inspired civs, technology, tapestries, and cities.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;&#10;In this third and final expansion to Tapestry, 10 new civilizations, 6 advanced capital city mats, 38 new tapestry cards, and 12 new tech cards are accompanied by a comprehensive rulebook that organizes all rules for Tapestry and the 3 expansions in one place (as well as a few replacement cards from previous expansions: 3 landmark cards, Oil Paint, and Migration). Some of the new tapestry cards include a new &ldquo;charm&rdquo; mechanism that provides one-time bonuses; some new tapestry and tech cards include exciting payoffs reserved for the final income turn.&#10;&#10;Fantasies &amp; Futures is fully compatible with any combination of the core game, the other Tapestry expansions, and the natural rubber playmat. It is packaged in an eco-friendly, recyclable envelope.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uDi09FWY0jD_sB7fMtXJNQ__original/img/Ph_taEFxmDn406zqiYbWD4tb7HQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7320021.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uDi09FWY0jD_sB7fMtXJNQ__thumb/img/8tHsHc84fZm5N_C8WkhWt_YiKLs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7320021.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.875,"rank":-1,"designers":["Chris Scaffidi","Mike Young"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games"],"artists":["Andrew Bosley"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
