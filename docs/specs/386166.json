You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.&#10;&#10;2. Build - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved.  When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.&#10;&#10;Winning the game - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.&#10;&#10;Variable player powers - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with many thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WH-73J7y3jrhNSUZiXNmrQ__original/img/ekRcZaF74eOpuycQJfjRkkN_jvQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7456764.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WH-73J7y3jrhNSUZiXNmrQ__thumb/img/nZOY41AYkEMlk-kwDqLoALZ5gBk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7456764.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Map Reduction","Race","Square Grid","Team-Based Game","Three Dimensional Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9,"rank":-1,"designers":["Gord!"],"publishers":["Roxley"],"artists":["Lina Cossette","David Forest"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
