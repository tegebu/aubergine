{"gameId":260789,"name":"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice","description":"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice is a co-operative miniature board game taking place in the heart of the Italian Renaissance through a story-driven campaign of 26 &quot;memories&quot; in Venice, in 1509. Choose your assassins according to their unique abilities, level up during the campaign, and unlock new skills for each of them.&#10;&#10;Fight or stay incognito thanks to the equipment found in chests or manufactured by Leonardo Da Vinci. Evade your pursuers by climbing on roofs and towers, then synchronize to reveal new game elements. Bribe your enemies, use secret hideouts to escape patrols, and flip mechanisms to change the level layout. After each memory, fall back to your headquarters to heal your wounds, grow your brotherhood's fame, and craft special equipment. The game features a save system that allows the number of players to vary between each campaign and the level of play adjusts according to the number of players.&#10;&#10;The retail edition of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice features the same scenarios as the original Kickstarter release and therefore the same gameplay experience. What has changed is that all of the miniatures other than the five detailed assassin figurines have been replaced with standees, so the game includes 5 miniatures, 139 standees, 6 secret envelopes, 41 tiles, and more than 400 cards.&#10;&#10;Many surprises await in the sealed envelopes. Meet the many famous personalities you've encountered in the Assassin's Creed video games as well as four unique ones created especially for this game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/huJQdINp8chuQbXdVD0chw__original/img/bwvtK6ygLi-hJSRW-4JnkDw9pSE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6753357.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/huJQdINp8chuQbXdVD0chw__thumb/img/TEGmikkD7omDL61pyQCCGijTq-A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6753357.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Events","Line of Sight","Modular Board","Multiple Maps","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Storytelling","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.25048,"averageRating":8.21473,"rank":1885,"designers":["Thibaud de la Touanne","Fabrice Lamidey","Manuel Rozoy"],"publishers":["Triton Noir","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Elznir Games","Portal Games","Synapses Games"],"artists":["ann&seb","Arnaud Boudoiron","Aurelie Bouquet","Stéphane Camosseto","Dimitri Chappuis","Émile Denis","Michael Jenkins","Aragorn Marks","Pascal Quidault","Edgar Ramos","Stéphane Simon","Edgar Skomorowski","Bruno Tatti","Paul Vérité","Tatiana Vetrova"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":12,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":13,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":4,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
