{"gameId":128721,"name":"Crisis","description":"Axia &mdash; a land with a glorious past, a most uncertain present, and an even more unpredictable future. Populated by what has been described as a fervent and warm-blooded people, Axia is in crisis &ndash; economic, social, and political: the longest-running recession in its modern history, the highest inequality in years, and a political system teetering on the brink of collapse.&#10;&#10;In more ways than one, Axia is fighting against itself. Old divisions of the past have given way to new ones, and this generation &ndash; along with the next ones &ndash; has the most to lose.&#10;&#10;Will you, along with your fellow industrialists, do your part to help Axia? Will you sacrifice short-term gain in the present for a brighter future? Can you do that, and survive? Perhaps you can, and perhaps you can even thrive &ndash; and you will, if you see opportunity where others only see crisis!&#10;&#10;CRISIS is a turn-based game for 1-5 players who assume the role of business leaders, trying to rebuild their businesses and create value at a particularly challenging time. By skillfully placing their managers in a position to invest in companies, trade resources, and navigate the local bureaucracy and regulations, they can thrive and prosper in a time when others might struggle and decline.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P2fFDm07xA2GAW34tOUm7g__original/img/L4fH2fYqqTODvqZl1eFA17UgALQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2994857.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P2fFDm07xA2GAW34tOUm7g__thumb/img/WvyBebO7zgSF33fbpDmJz4zzI28=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2994857.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Commodity Speculation","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2016,"bggRating":6.50483,"averageRating":7.53905,"rank":1102,"designers":["Pantelis Bouboulis","Sotirios Tsantilas"],"publishers":["LudiCreations","Geek Attitude Games"],"artists":["Anthony Cournoyer","Viktor Csete"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":17,"notRecommended":17,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":9,"recommended":23,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":24,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":6,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
