{"gameId":311900,"name":"Votes for Women","description":"Votes for Women is a card-driven game covering the American women's suffrage movement from 1848-1920, culminating with the ratification (or rejection) of the Nineteenth Amendment. The game provides competitive, co-operative and solitaire play, with co-operative and solitaire play against the &quot;Oppobot.&quot;&#10;&#10;To win, the Suffragist player must have Congress pass the proposed Amendment and then have three-fourths of the states (36 of the then 48 states) ratify the Amendment. The Opposition player wins by either preventing Congress from passing the proposed Amendment or by having 13 states reject the Amendment.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for six turns - a turn consisting of drawing cards from the players' own decks, bidding on strategy cards, and then six rounds of card play where a player may play a card for an event or discard a card to campaign, organize or lobby Congress.  If Congress has proposed the Amendment but neither 36 states have ratified nor 13 states have rejected, then the game goes to Final Voting.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RotpVPn98B5sDSS8VTzTJQ__original/img/wXzPP1T99-BfeEOj_yL4LHLq-FU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6430938.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RotpVPn98B5sDSS8VTzTJQ__thumb/img/WZ5C_84yftaJFU3oprFzDHIRgV0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6430938.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":75,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.91827,"averageRating":7.82405,"rank":3333,"designers":["Tory Brown"],"publishers":["Fort Circle Games"],"artists":["Brigette Indelicato","Marc Rodrigue (II)"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":12,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
