An anonymous act of sabotage has sent the ship plummeting to the surface of a frozen uncharted planet. Damaged beyond repair, the scattered remains will do little to protect you from the brutal cold.&#10;&#10;In the engine-building, worker placement game Cryo, leaders of separate, hostile factions compete to survive and claim control over the underground caverns on a remote icy planet. You need to act quickly and strategically to avoid further sabotage from other factions. Send drones out from your engineering platform to scavenge resources and save your crew still in cryostasis. Gather different materials to upgrade and customize your platform, fine-tuning new actions to suit your individual strategy. Utilize multi-use cards to your advantage, and claim the underground caverns for your faction to survive.&#10;&#10;Though unplanned, a new chapter for humanity has begun. Scavenge, build, explore, and lead your faction to victory within this frozen world before the sun sets!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iJuOcywlYkbWJmDtioACWg__original/img/TOGnbs7VNh2PhMZ4w4zOzHRHLmo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5970903.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iJuOcywlYkbWJmDtioACWg__thumb/img/nQ5WgIeYxNRnWn_1NmyoOvdSub8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5970903.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.97694,"averageRating":7.35972,"rank":2638,"designers":["Tom Jolly","Luke Laurie"],"publishers":["Z-Man Games","Asmodee China","Hobby World"],"artists":["Bree Lindsoe","Jasmine Radue","Samuel R.
