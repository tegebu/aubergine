{"gameId":283355,"name":"Dune","description":"Imagine you can control the forces of a noble family, guild, or religious order on a barren planet which is the only source for the most valuable substance in the known universe.&#10;&#10;Imagine you can rewrite the script for one of the most famous science fiction books of all time. Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s DUNE.&#10;&#10;In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.&#10;&#10;Who will control DUNE? Become one of the characters and their forces from the book and . . . You decide!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/MhbVaQPBZ9ez2TpMl20xGHQ6hno=/0x0/pic4815198.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/OrjzwJVfE8Qnk8e5efbae5EaSeY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4815198.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Alliances","Area Majority / Influence","Auction/Bidding","Force Commitment","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":6.98165,"averageRating":8.22554,"rank":397,"designers":["Bill Eberle","Jack Kittredge","Peter Olotka"],"publishers":["Gale Force Nine, LLC"],"artists":["Ilya Baranovsky"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":72,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":70,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":66,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":21,"notRecommended":49,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":7,"recommended":52,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":76,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":39,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
