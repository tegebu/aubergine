{"gameId":283355,"name":"Dune","description":"Imagine you can control the forces of a noble family, guild, or religious order on a barren planet which is the only source for the most valuable substance in the known universe.&#10;&#10;Imagine you can rewrite the script for one of the most famous science fiction books of all time. Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s DUNE.&#10;&#10;In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.&#10;&#10;Who will control DUNE? Become one of the characters and their forces from the book and . . . You decide!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2fgPg6Be--w97zoycObUgg__original/img/7PyNxWs85_OKGOm_jYVFvPwAViE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4815198.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2fgPg6Be--w97zoycObUgg__thumb/img/OrjzwJVfE8Qnk8e5efbae5EaSeY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4815198.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Alliances","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Auction/Bidding","Bribery","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Force Commitment","Map Deformation","Negotiation","Predictive Bid","Take That","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":7.34474,"averageRating":7.95317,"rank":189,"designers":["Bill Eberle","Jack Kittredge","Peter Olotka"],"publishers":["Gale Force Nine, LLC"],"artists":["Ilya Baranovsky"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":173,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":170,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":24,"notRecommended":155,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":13,"recommended":72,"notRecommended":96,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":20,"recommended":134,"notRecommended":27,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":186,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":6,"recommended":17,"notRecommended":88,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
