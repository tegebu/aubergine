{"gameId":330152,"name":"Nature","description":"Nature is a strategy board game that stands on the shoulders of Evolution. The innovation of Nature is a modular game system that allows you to create and explore a unique ecosystem each time you play. There is no limit to the number of modules you can add. You can play Nature on its own, or combine modules to create over 20 unique ecosystems. Experience a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. Adapt your species with traits like Fast to evade predators, Nesting to grow your population, or Climbing to reach fruit high in the canopy.&#10;&#10;The goal of Nature is to adapt your species in an ever-changing ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. You receive points for growing and sustaining a flourishing population. To grow your population, your species must adapt to the changing environment amidst two threats: starvation and predation. A game of Nature takes 4 rounds, or 5 when you play with modules. Each round, players draw a hand of cards and gain a new species, bringing new life and opportunity into the ecosystem. Rounds have 2 main phases: Adapting and Feeding. Score points for feeding your species&rsquo; population and keeping them alive. Score the most points to win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rNOQrjNmhTaBmaAyZah8cA__original/img/5sUjBWXScLovzOPg0C2a3Kx091E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8115796.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rNOQrjNmhTaBmaAyZah8cA__thumb/img/xSEV-lmGayPsB3m8ADrZH1zWQbQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8115796.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Chaining","Hand Management","Simulation","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.56407,"averageRating":7.38367,"rank":10890,"designers":["Dominic Crapuchettes"],"publishers":["NorthStar Game Studio"],"artists":["Catherine Hamilton"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
