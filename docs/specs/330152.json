{"gameId":330152,"name":"Nature","description":"Nature is a modular game system that allows you to build and explore a unique ecosystem each time you play. Experience a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. Adapt your species with traits like Fast to evade predators, Nesting to grow your population, or Climbing to reach fruit high in the canopy. Welcome to the beauty of Nature, where every game brings new worlds to explore!&#10;&#10;Nature is easy to get to the table.  The modular system means Nature can be tailored to any group.  Do you want a more aggressive environment? Add the Jurassic module to assert your dominance with huge apex predator. Do you want a less aggressive environment? Add the Flight module where flight brings the freedom to evade predators and fly to a safe haven island to raise a family.  Are you introducing Nature to casual gamers? Don't add any modules and the game can be taught and played in less than an hour. Each module adds a layer of complexity and 15 - 30 minutes to the gametime. At launch, the Nature game system will have 15 unique configurations.&#10;&#10;NorthStar will support the Nature game system for the next decade with 1 - 2 modules a year. The Climate module and the Disease module is slated for release in 2026. After the release of Climate and Disease, the Nature game system will have 33 unique configurations to explore. Each new module added to the system will generate an explonentially increasing number of combinations!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rNOQrjNmhTaBmaAyZah8cA__original/img/5sUjBWXScLovzOPg0C2a3Kx091E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8115796.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rNOQrjNmhTaBmaAyZah8cA__thumb/img/xSEV-lmGayPsB3m8ADrZH1zWQbQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8115796.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Chaining","Hand Management","Simulation"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.62667,"rank":-1,"designers":["Dominic Crapuchettes"],"publishers":["NorthStar Game Studio"],"artists":["Catherine Hamilton"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
