{"gameId":394073,"name":"The Eternaut","description":"A deadly snowfall is killing everyone it touches, but not everyone has fallen victim to this mysterious threat. Four people have survived in a workshop, and now they're venturing into the world at the start of a survival adventure in which they must face menaces far more dangerous than the deadly snowflakes.&#10;&#10;The Eternaut is a story-driven co-operative survival board game for 1-5 players set in Buenos Aires that uses simple game mechanisms to create a survival experience with strong narrative elements. You must build a team, gather items, fight enemies, resolve objectives, and decide how to proceed with your unique story.&#10;&#10;Most of the entities in the game are marked with an Identification Number (called ID). When you want to instruct one of your Characters to interact with another entity (with another ID), you must play the correct Action card and read the matching paragraph, numbered with the combination of the 2 IDs. example: The player wants Simon to scavenge a metal cabinet, so they assign him a Rummage card. This action lets Simon (904) interact with the cabinet (124):  the player must read the Paragraph 124-904 in the Storybook to discover the result of the interaction. Each Scenario has a dedicated Storybook, so the same interaction between two entities is completely different in distinct scenarios.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yrWtM-4o-n5r4m1nXobXdA__original/img/VRjveUNxoqmMCcmQebLbRiCO5QQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7619942.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yrWtM-4o-n5r4m1nXobXdA__thumb/img/joqblUmzuExnNW5owQeNtwjVRDs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7619942.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Deck Construction","Events","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":5.4,"rank":-1,"designers":["Mauro Chiabotto"],"publishers":["Pendragon Game Studio"],"artists":["Davide Corsi","Maciej Simi≈Ñski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
