{"gameId":394073,"name":"The Eternaut","description":"A deadly snowfall is killing everyone it touches, but not everyone has fallen victim to this mysterious threat. Four people have survived in a workshop, and now they're venturing into the world at the start of a survival adventure in which they must face menaces far more dangerous than the deadly snowflakes.&#10;&#10;The Eternaut is a story-driven co-operative survival board game for 1-4 players set in Buenos Aires that uses simple game mechanisms to create a survival experience with strong narrative elements. You must build a team, gather items, fight enemies, resolve objectives, and decide how to proceed with your unique story.&#10;&#10;The game gives players maximum freedom, allowing them to interact as they please with the surroundings. Inspired by the point-and-click games from decades past &mdash; not to mention the famed comic of the same name by H&eacute;ctor Germ&aacute;n Oesterheld &mdash; in The Eternaut the player-characters can talk about a variety of topics; interact with items like doors, shelves and vehicles; and even combine apparently useless items in new, stronger items.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yrWtM-4o-n5r4m1nXobXdA__original/img/VRjveUNxoqmMCcmQebLbRiCO5QQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7619942.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yrWtM-4o-n5r4m1nXobXdA__thumb/img/joqblUmzuExnNW5owQeNtwjVRDs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7619942.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Deck Construction","Events","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.5,"rank":-1,"designers":["Mauro Chiabotto"],"publishers":["Pendragon Game Studio"],"artists":["Davide Corsi","Maciej Simi≈Ñski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
