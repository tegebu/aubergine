{"gameId":360226,"name":"Viticulture World: Cooperative Expansion","description":"Cooperate with members of your extended winemaking family in various&nbsp;asymmetric&nbsp;regions around the world in Viticulture World: Cooperative Expansion as you try to achieve global recognition. Balance the management of your individual vineyard with the combined effort of your fellow players to gain influence within the region.&#10;&#10;Using the new game board, tiles, tokens, and event cards combined with the original vineyard mats and game cards, you have six years to achieve the two conditions necessary for victory in the selected region: (1) Each player must reach 25 victory points and (2) the shared influence token must reach the end of the influence track. The cooperation, objectives, and asymmetry in this expansion are similar to that of Spirit Island and Orleans: Invasion.&#10;&#10;The Viticulture core game is required to play the Viticulture World expansion. Other expansions are compatible with this expansion.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dPjso_7GLXiW0uO7oe6-xw__original/img/fYDLonzs_sZtMvsrUEtjeMjRDL0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6809375.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dPjso_7GLXiW0uO7oe6-xw__thumb/img/4w-Pex6mZvONuT4tQeyBdeOUCeo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6809375.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Contracts","Cooperative Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Auction","Victory Points as a Resource","Worker Placement","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.1,"rank":-1,"designers":["Mihir Shah","Francesco Testini"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games","Ghenos Games"],"artists":["Andrew Bosley"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
