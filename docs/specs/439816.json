{"gameId":439816,"name":"Lost Ruins of Arnak: Adventure Chest","description":"The adventure is calling to you once again &mdash; and this time, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about packing light!&#10;&#10;The Adventure Chest is a brand-new expansion to Lost Ruins of Arnak that features most previously released Lost Ruins of Arnak content. The Adventure Chest box is bigger and sturdier than that of the base game &mdash; and it still fits into a Kallax shelf. The insert itself is made of 8 individual boxes from layered PET material and is designed to make setup, play, and cleanup as easy as possible.&#10;&#10;Inside the Adventure Chest is a fresh addition to the world of Arnak: the new expansion Twisted Paths. This expansion brings a new double-sided map bigger than the one in the base game and includes two new research tracks, each with unique mechanisms and components (like brand new temple tiles or new resources&mdash;dark tablets). In addition to new maps, the expansion contains new guardians, sites, and assistants, and also some solo content &mdash; Rival tiles for the new maps, as well as Purple Rival tiles and Rival Objectives, two mini expansions previously released online as print-and-play.&#10;&#10;The Adventure Chest does NOT include any other Lost Ruins of Arnak content. The base game or any of the two previous expansions, Expedition Leaders or The Missing Expedition, must be purchased separately.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8m4T1bSYZ1DhZFRIHpCSig__original/img/T36dYSqZH8ztZfC-eiUnSQPvNjs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8739079.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8m4T1bSYZ1DhZFRIHpCSig__thumb/img/vfiofq7QhTaf_85AHotAvHDXnPY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8739079.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Deck Construction","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.61797,"averageRating":8.33512,"rank":-1,"designers":["Elwen","Mín"],"publishers":["Czech Games Edition","Cranio Creations","HeidelBÄR Games"],"artists":["Ondřej Hrdina","Jiří Kůs","Jakub Politzer"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
