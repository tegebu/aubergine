{"gameId":351648,"name":"Dragons Down","description":"Dragons Down is inspired by the classic board game, Magic Realm.&#10;&#10;I thought they were crazy, rebuilding civilization on the exact place where the dragons had come down from the sky. Even if it had been over 200 years, everyone knows a dragon's lifetime can be far longer than that. Yet, here I am like all the other fools. Driven by my thirst for fame and to fill my satchel with coin, I arrived in the village at the same time as the other adventurers...&#10;&#10;Dragons Down is an adventure game inspired by the classic game, Magic Realm. The game is set in Western fantasy where players act as adventurers seeking fame and glory seeking hidden treasure sites, looting great treasures and epic artifacts, fighting monsters... and perhaps each other, all while attempting to become a legend.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players can hide from monsters and other players, move around the realm, search for treasure sites and hidden paths, loot found treasure sites, stay alert for trouble, prepare magic, enchant the realm, and/or rest from their wounds. By slaying monsters, looting epic treasures, completing quests, or even hunting down your fellow adventurers, players accumulate fame and fortune. Although a winner is crowned for collecting the most fame and retiring (or dying), the game is a very large sandbox that can be played with your own goals in mind.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7xYmck_-GjMs3ySbwk9vLQ__original/img/gxRF8aRPR9YQAfNUsIZXwosoDrE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7763582.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7xYmck_-GjMs3ySbwk9vLQ__thumb/img/vqq2bJBzN6sPRatCGlGv7eWygBQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7763582.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action / Event","Action Points","Alliances","Cooperative Game","Critical Hits and Failures","Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid","Impulse Movement","Modular Board","Multiple Maps","Solo / Solitaire Game","Storytelling","Turn Order: Random","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.62099,"averageRating":8.8033,"rank":7776,"designers":["Scott DeMers"],"publishers":["Mr. B Games","Active Magic Games"],"artists":["Marco Primo"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
