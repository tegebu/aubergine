{"gameId":445048,"name":"SETI: Space Agencies","description":"SETI: Space Agencies, an expansion for SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, introduces powerful asymmetric organizations &mdash; each with unique abilities, strategic advantages, and starting conditions that redefine how you approach the search for alien life.&#10;&#10;As the leader of one of these institutions &mdash; ranging from private tech companies to global research networks &mdash; you'll bring a distinct perspective and specialized tools to the mission, unlocking bold new strategies and rewarding long-term planning.&#10;&#10;In addition to these organizations, the expansion adds three new alien species, each with their own unique twists, and over forty new project cards inspired by real-world initiatives. These integrate seamlessly into the main deck, providing even greater variety and strategic options.&#10;&#10;&quot;Quick Start&quot; cards, designed for use with the organizations, let you skip the slower opening round and dive straight into the action. They introduce an extra layer of asymmetry during set-up and can be used to further accelerate games in lower player counts.&#10;&#10;Finally, the expansion introduces signal tokens, a subtle but meaningful new mechanism that enhances scanning efficiency.&#10;&#10;Whether you're adapting to your organization's strengths or navigating fresh interstellar challenges, SETI: Space Agencies deepens the strategic landscape of your mission to discover life beyond Earth.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JMLgq_A4OE_dX423FeFcPA__original/img/75BD_5fAbW6gCvFOKSefCQpKNeY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8857305.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JMLgq_A4OE_dX423FeFcPA__thumb/img/L0iyv7R4pYVqA6KX5Ox6RNnpugk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8857305.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":160,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Income","Multi-Use Cards","Resource to Move","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7,"rank":-1,"designers":["Tomáš Holek"],"publishers":["Czech Games Edition (CGE)","DSV Games"],"artists":["Ondřej Hrdina","Jiří Kůs","Jiří Mikovec","Jakub Politzer","Petr Štich"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
