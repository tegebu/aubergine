As heads of influential families, the players strive to come to power with cunning and malice, power and strength, virtue and infamy. Their goal: the king's throne!&#10;&#10;In the tactical card game, hidden cards are played in turn. By tactically uncovering and activating their effects, players can outdo or get them out of the way, because all players have the same goal in mind &mdash; to collect the most influence points for their family and thus win the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8MpTeqlzyIupMpSSxP3PAw__original/img/XoqLo4dQlXvFHZBAcKbZheA8NHA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4949335.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8MpTeqlzyIupMpSSxP3PAw__thumb/img/NACmpm6Pzd2IrmAq9teXwLlmKqA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4949335.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Betting and Bluffing","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":6.30982,"averageRating":7.20304,"rank":1437,"designers":["Adrien Hesling","Axel Hesling"],"publishers":["Studio H","Albi","Arclight","Bur√≥","Evrikus","Galakta","Geekach Games","Gen-X Games","Geronimo Games","Mandoo Games","MS Edizioni","Pegasus Spiele","Popcorn Games","Reflexshop","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."],"artists":["Tomasz Jedruszek"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":21,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":8,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
