{"gameId":332614,"name":"The Paradox Initiative","description":"&quot;Our newest discovery changes everything! Our paradox engine lets us manipulate paradox particles, the fundamental building blocks of reality. Past, present, and future&mdash;none are beyond our grasp, and nobody can stand in our way! Except, that is, maybe the frauds at that rival paradox lab down the street. Quickly, to the control room. Switch off the safeties, there&rsquo;s renown to be won!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In The Paradox Initiative, players are mad scientists competing to claim strands of spacetime from worlds all across the multiverse. Who can most efficiently operate their particle-matching &quot;Paradox Engine&quot; to collect strands from the different worlds? Be careful! Every captured strand of spacetime sends ripples throughout existence, collapsing the wormholes that future generations will need to reap the benefits of your reckless experiments.&#10;&#10;The Paradox Initiative takes the familiar board game elements of card drafting, set collection, and resource management, then adds a Bejewelled-like grid of discs for each player to manipulate. As a result, The Paradox Initiative is simple to learn, yet challenging to master, with players navigating three interlocking systems to grab as much spacetime as they can to be hailed the greatest scientist in the universe!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mfep0cn3D0Nq7UpLpaUQyQ__original/img/Fi_4cjDkKw8WyVVPW9gIynNTG9A=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6607369.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mfep0cn3D0Nq7UpLpaUQyQ__thumb/img/QEZ2WFruH0HvCo523ATTGMKfdiE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6607369.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Open Drafting","Pattern Building","Pattern Recognition","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.5,"rank":-1,"designers":["Brian Suhre"],"publishers":["Elf Creek Games"],"artists":["Andrew Bosley","Sébastien Caiveau","Marie Cardouat","David Cochard","Lina Cossette","Jacqui Davis","Mihajlo Dimitrievski","Xavier Gueniffey Durin","Vincent Dutrait","Klemens Franz","Anne Heidsieck","Ryan Laukat","Michael Menzel","Kwanchai Moriya","Ian O'Toole","Pierô","Beth Sobel","Manny Trembley","Weberson Santiago"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
