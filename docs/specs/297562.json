Get ready to become an Egyptian God, open the gates of your city, and let your troops sing the song of war to please you and claim your dominance as master of Ancient Egypt.&#10;&#10;Kemet: Blood and Sand features new art and upgraded gameplay with new approachable rules that go beyond the 1.5 version of Kemet developed with the help of the BGG community. Free from the constraints of existing components, designers Jacques Bariot and Guillaume Montiage go even further in fine-tuning the Kemet experience.&#10;&#10;The game also features a redesigned map with a twist, bigger and more detailed figurines, and other surprises.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IU-az-0jlIpoUxDHCCclNw__original/img/UXp8jCSt7DxXUIPqTPZY4EBBtJg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6230640.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IU-az-0jlIpoUxDHCCclNw__thumb/img/-S3brxcCPrlKmYk8MrWCkVdOgxw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6230640.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Card Drafting","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.4014,"averageRating":8.3853,"rank":1230,"designers":["Jacques Bariot","Guillaume Montiage"],"publishers":["Matagot","Asobition (アソビション)","Delta Vision Publishing","Frosted Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Maldito Games","Pendragon Game Studio","Surfin' Meeple China","Tower Tactic Games"],"artists":["Arnaud Boudoiron","Pierre Santamaria"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":17,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":17,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":6,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
