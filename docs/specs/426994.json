{"gameId":426994,"name":"Urbion (Second Edition)","description":"For eons, the happy Sognae and the sad Incubi have dwelled as opposed but complementary forces in the library-city of dreams.&#10;&#10;Your task in Urbion is to maintain this delicate equilibrium: Place the dreams in the various districts of the city, and balance their strengths so that neither group becomes more powerful than the other.&#10;&#10;During the game, you want to claim all the city cards by playing your dream cards so that the positive and negative values balance each other out. Manage your cards wisely by placing them in the best spots or by discarding them to trigger powerful effects that will help you achieve your goal.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Urbion features new art by Elise Plessis and seven expansions.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tBbItW7cMRyMDbhE6MjI7A__original/img/HEmx5CtIa9c_6acAG2YiRbaMcFo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8379521.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tBbItW7cMRyMDbhE6MjI7A__thumb/img/_WVpzMeuHDe8yYqlTYxhBuq4_LU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8379521.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Hand Management","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.66429,"rank":-1,"designers":["Shadi Torbey"],"publishers":["inPatience","Devir","HUCH!"],"artists":["Ã‰lise Plessis"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
