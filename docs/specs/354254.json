{"gameId":354254,"name":"Voices In My Head","description":"In Voices In My Head, players step into the courtroom and into the mind of a man on trial for robbing a bank. One player takes on the role of the prosecutor who is trying to convict the defendant, Guy, and send him to prison; everyone else takes on aspects of Guy's personality, such as Honesty or Selfishness, and attempts to influence the trial. To win the game, each player must achieve their hidden goal.&#10;&#10;Each round, the prosecutor plays a trial card to present evidence, call witnesses, or grill Guy on the stand. Players then try to control Guy's actions by deploying control markers to a three-dimensional game board representing his brain. These actions will sway the jury in different ways and ultimately determine whether Guy goes free or is sent to prison.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fWhs2QYHfmxgFeO20wSc4A__original/img/6vMYaV3G4Gi42CkofZP-Uk3Dicw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6604929.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fWhs2QYHfmxgFeO20wSc4A__thumb/img/BwH4myoxhYJZQZrlJ0L9AgBarHU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6604929.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Team-Based Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.13333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Corey Konieczka"],"publishers":["Unexpected Games","GÃ©m Klub Kft."],"artists":["David Ardila","George Doutsiopoulos"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
