{"gameId":330543,"name":"Lasting Tales","description":"Lasting Tales is a cooperative tabletop miniatures game for 1&ndash;5 players. Designed by acclaimed game designer Mark Latham (The Walking Dead: All Out War, The Elder Scrolls: Call to Arms), Lasting Tales lets players create their own heroes and embark on an epic campaign, linking game sessions together to create a rich story set in a classic fantasy world. &#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;Inspired by pen-and-paper roleplaying games and tabletop skirmish games, Lasting Tales is a fully cooperative experience in which every player is the hero in their own tale, battling the enemy on their own or with their friends, and crafting their legend through the variety of events they&rsquo;ll stumble upon during their journeys.&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;The Lasting Tales book contains all the rules you need to play the game, including hero creation, adversary profiles, campaign rules, scenarios, as well as a full narrative campaign&mdash;or Tale&mdash;and pre-made heroes to get new players right into the action! A game of Lasting Tales will also require a handful of standard six-sided dice, a tape measure or ruler, and miniatures. Fortunately, Lasting Tales is a miniatures-agnostic game, meaning players can use any fantasy miniatures in their collection.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x4KQCjnofAKu3b4X8VQK4w__original/img/3zIY5wxu0x54XF0FyIf1OSyJVZ4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5963681.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x4KQCjnofAKu3b4X8VQK4w__thumb/img/jC4zDyGONLbO_cna-spqV6rpnAY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5963681.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Measurement Movement","Paper-and-Pencil","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.6,"rank":-1,"designers":["Mark Latham"],"publishers":["Blacklist Games"],"artists":["Diego Gisbert Llorens"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
