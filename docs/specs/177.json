{"gameId":177,"name":"Advanced Civilization","description":"The use of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; to describe this expansion followed existing Avalon Hill tradition, &quot;Enhanced&quot; is likely more appropriate.  Playing with this expansion is no more difficult than playing the base Civilization game.  This expansion reworks a few of the original rules, includes a reworked version of Civilization Expansion Trade Cards Set, and adds more civilization advancements to the technology tree.&#10;&#10;Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which removes the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogeneous, while others claim the reverse is true.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9ROB7NpxefRUmpR9UroQ8w__original/img/--qlhvNNj8zF9cWLlihdTg0jzmE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic87459.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9ROB7NpxefRUmpR9UroQ8w__thumb/img/XDH667tVl2KjQ6szNjT7ceEmh5E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic87459.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":480,"mechanics":["Area Movement","Commodity Speculation","Set Collection","Trading"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":1991,"bggRating":7.13442,"averageRating":8.02178,"rank":-1,"designers":["Lauren Banerd","Jim Eliason","Jeff Groteboer","Bruce Harper","Eric Hunter","Steven Padgett","Gary Rapanos","Michael Roos","Jennifer Schlickbernd","Jeff Suchard"],"publishers":["The Avalon Hill Game Co"],"artists":["Rodger B.
