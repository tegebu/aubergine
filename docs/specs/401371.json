{"gameId":401371,"name":"Colonial 1700-1800","description":"Colonial 1700-1800 is a strategic card game for 1 to 5 players that recreates the struggle between the European powers to preserve their colonial empires in the 18th century. The basic game faces France and Great Britain (2-player games), although the powers of Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal can also be involved through expansions (up to 5-player games). The game combines eurogame type mechanics (set collection, hand management, resource production) with other wargame type mechanics (direct confrontation between players, troop recruitment, territorial control of colonies, resolution of battles).&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NZC1U2qvtqCPI2xsV3kWEQ__original/img/QyXPEvgRe8h1FDu0GUauutdNMX4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7734362.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NZC1U2qvtqCPI2xsV3kWEQ__thumb/img/EgabDdg6KM4SGfau0vnJrAMBA14=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7734362.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Set Collection","Zone of Control"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.125,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jos√© Manuel Sanz"],"publishers":["Juegos Mosquete"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
