{"gameId":365526,"name":"Galactic Renaissance","description":"Following Inis, Galactic Renaissance is the second installment of the &quot;Political Trilogy&quot; by designer Christian Martinez and publisher Matagot.&#10;&#10;Throughout Galactic Renaissance, you build your team, adding new specialists &mdash; each one unique &mdash; to the core in your deck of cards. With this team, you discover new planets and systems, reconnect with lost civilizations, expand your influence, build embassies, and sow disorder in opposing factions &mdash; all in an effort to score victory points faster than your opponents. Sending emissaries to new planets, for example, allows you to discover new civilizations or cement relationships on known planets. Opponents may try to convince a planet to join them instead with their own emissaries, causing disorder in the process.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Af7WBXcjbTuWPRAaPWm45A__original/img/vqd9ipTTUtgQ_Xhc7pP0uxZMOFA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7364206.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Af7WBXcjbTuWPRAaPWm45A__thumb/img/GXSPmCSMXEJEjsy0gJi5HFYyWZc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7364206.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Modular Board"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.76918,"averageRating":7.17526,"rank":4929,"designers":["Christian Martinez"],"publishers":["Matagot","Gen-X Games","Lavka Games","Lord of Boards"],"artists":["Tano Bonfanti"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
