{"gameId":379055,"name":"Thorgal: The Card Game","description":"You are the leader of one of the four factions: Vikings, People of the Stars, Outlaws or Magnates. As such, you gather a party of allies (from the characters from Thorgal comic books series) and equip them with things from ordinary everyday items, weapons, armors and ships through ancient artifacts and animal companions. The equipped party will then set off to the dangerous quests in order to conquer other lands. In order to help your party to overcome the obstacles they meet on their way you play cards with permanent or instant effects.&#10;&#10;Of course, your opponent won&rsquo;t wait patiently for you to conquer, but will play his own heroes, mythological creatures or obstacles from their Deck of Doom in order to bring your party to defeat.&#10;&#10;If, despite your opponent&rsquo;s efforts, you will manage to conquer chosen land, you will be rewarded with priceless horn (a.k.a. victory point) and immediate bonus. But for your opponent it will mean new ability to utilize in next rounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends after one of you will gain their third horn or when someone will ran out of the cards in their Deck of Destiny.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A7Um9VK7epigVZfbqnR_yg__original/img/6bimzbgCV1DDcb5FJJCWlYLy3mI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7363898.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A7Um9VK7epigVZfbqnR_yg__thumb/img/slxCdE4g4mHNseNPpFFgrk2AW0I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7363898.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Sudden Death Ending","Take That","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.52072,"averageRating":8.65,"rank":16905,"designers":["Marcin Tomczyk"],"publishers":["Lucrum Games","Lucrum Studio"],"artists":["Grzegorz Rosi≈Ñski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
