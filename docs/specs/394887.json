{"gameId":394887,"name":"Surfosaurus MAX","description":"Outcooperate the competition!&#10;&#10;Surfosaurus MAX's cards come in seven suits, with values from 01 to 12. The higher a card's value, the fewer victory points are on it.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn, you play a single hand card and draw a new one immediately. Once the right number of cards has been reached, the one strongest possible combination out of all the cards played by all the players wins. If you contributed a card to the winning combination, you get to score it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_oIGFfPMAa0gHWNy7kJp7g__original/img/p96DvDrI5EBJNcZ-Wr6Gc95cVl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7618281.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_oIGFfPMAa0gHWNy7kJp7g__thumb/img/sDjXtzwxUmWreaMwHw8ofJaCaKc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7618281.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Semi-Cooperative Game","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.55558,"averageRating":7.224,"rank":11041,"designers":["Ikhwan Kwon"],"publishers":["Loosey Goosey Games"],"artists":["Matthias MÃ¶dl"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
