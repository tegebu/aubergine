{"gameId":387514,"name":"Stonespine Architects","description":"Dungeon-crafting is an ancient minotaur art that you've studied for a decade under Master Hortgully. To demonstrate your skill, as your final project you must carve your own perilous labyrinth into the base of the Stonespine Mountains.&#10;&#10;Stonespine Architects is a card-drafting game in which 1-5 players compete to construct the most dangerous labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously draft and play cards to expand their dungeons, one chamber at a time. Follow a unique blueprint and a variety of scoring challenges. Choose between mapping a path through your underground passages, placing key elements in your rooms, or searching for extra treasure.&#10;&#10;Spend gold between rounds to customize your labyrinth with monsters, traps, treasures, and secret passages. At the end of four years, the player with the most perilous dungeon will earn the title of Master Architect!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/reyY-4k4eJ55CPd_2CXCKA__original/img/63t67q02KWS4QXA_0HYymanKuxs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7985356.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/reyY-4k4eJ55CPd_2CXCKA__thumb/img/AJOu9-jfFi9twauiJQoI2_u4pPQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7985356.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Closed Drafting","Contracts","Hand Management","Pattern Building","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":6.34414,"averageRating":7.52375,"rank":1633,"designers":["Jordy Adan"],"publishers":["Thunderworks Games","Gém Klub Kft.","Gen-X Games","Intrafin Games","Ogry Games","Pegasus Spiele","REXhry"],"artists":["Jordy Adan","Damien Mammoliti","Lucas Ribeiro","Diego Sá"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":5,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":7,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":14,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":21,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":4,"recommended":17,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
