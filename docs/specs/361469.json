{"gameId":361469,"name":"Bretwalda","description":"796 AD. Dark Ages Britain. Viking raiders are conquering swathes of land, paganism is being replaced by Christianity. And the four largest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms &ndash; Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, and East Anglia &ndash; are in a constant game of diplomacy, alliance building, and conflict to claim the crown of Bretwalda, ruler of Britain.&#10;&#10;Bretwalda is a fast-paced area control game for 1-4 players with unique miniatures and beautiful, evocative components. You take charge of one of the four asymmetric kingdoms. To achieve victory, you will need to take control of key areas on the board, complete secret objectives and construct special buildings. To do that, you will collect taxes, develop your kingdom, use your diplomatic skills, mobilize armies, and lead them to glorious battles.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a maximum of 12 seasons, each season limited to just two out of four available actions, meaning each decision is critical. Will you bide your time, developing your economy, expanding your knowledge, and building alliances, or will you immediately create a great army and rush forward to claim new lands and riches?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO6f6sncc4-BloyyCfpi2A__original/img/lt3q7C2Qpn4j3IsNHOpwl35VvLs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6824856.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO6f6sncc4-BloyyCfpi2A__thumb/img/tkcnXkkz5Rm1HrLLfuowxaMeYd0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6824856.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Movement Points","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.53301,"averageRating":7.15279,"rank":14469,"designers":["Leo Soloviey"],"publishers":["PHALANX","Maldito Games"],"artists":["Leo Soloviey"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
