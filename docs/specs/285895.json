{"gameId":285895,"name":"Islands in the Mist","description":"The islands still lie beneath the dense fog. The farther you go over the island with your balloon, the more the fog lifts and you explore the breathtaking landscape.&#10;&#10;Use the local wind skilfully to save energy. Because you still need it often enough to accelerate or decelerate. Steer completely against the wind at the right time to reach your goal.&#10;&#10;You will discover the neighbouring landscape where the balloon is by placing tiles on the adjacent fields. This is how cities are built, monuments are erected and landscapes grow.&#10;&#10;As the first of the game round you have the possibility to get more landscape tiles. As the last one you will probably only get one tile, but you can determine the wind direction, which can also be a decisive advantage.&#10;&#10;Once a player has connected all the landscapes to the balloon yard, the game ends.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2QJPDKcVdIEcOMU7ltX-sA__original/img/dBSy1R59o4HM5mVwnkumAwN5U4s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5932016.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2QJPDKcVdIEcOMU7ltX-sA__thumb/img/njwdp5zpcKeTn8qxerAETxprvhg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5932016.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Open Drafting","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":5.68482,"averageRating":7.00016,"rank":5400,"designers":["Volker Sch√§chtele"],"publishers":["Schmidt Spiele","Stronghold Games"],"artists":["Michael Menzel"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
