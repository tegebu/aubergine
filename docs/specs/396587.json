{"gameId":396587,"name":"Colossal Cat in the Box","description":"Colossal Cat in the Box is an oversized version of the breakout quantum trick-taking game Cat in the Box, featuring a supersized version of the original game, two new expansions, and even more deluxe components.. We&rsquo;ve upsized everything at least 4x their original size (except the cards, which are higher quality with a white edge on the backs), and added/replaced items for a massively improved gameplay experience. There are bigger player boards, a larger customizable central research board, bigger rules and scorepad, giant translucent plastic heavyweight double-sided player tokens, and even a huge start player mini! All of this in a standard 12 x 12 x 3 box, complete with cat-shaped GameTrayz trays for your player tokens and a GameTrayz tray for organizing all of the components in the box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qiLfkSTKolGUlWMepDdu_g__original/img/sB8rnm_rCSpD7nySVkrh6lMKSu4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7657640.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qiLfkSTKolGUlWMepDdu_g__thumb/img/TOKsNHCnvQDT3T_TECaH_Uf0FrQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7657640.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Enclosure","Hand Management","Predictive Bid","Trick-taking"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.42857,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ted Alspach","Muneyuki Yokouchi (横内宗幸)"],"publishers":["Bézier Games"],"artists":["Osamu Inoue (井上磨)"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
