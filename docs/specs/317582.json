Each role a player can choose in Mythwind is completely unique - one may be rooted in action-selection, the other in deck-building or worker placement - roles are 100% asymmetrical.  The game relies on the passage of time and the progression of the player's abilities and possessions to create an engaging and persistent world.&#10;&#10;Mythwind is a true open-ended game. Setup in under five minutes, and whenever you want to finish your gameplay session, pack it up without losing any of your progression. The game will live and grow as you spend more time progressing in your role and building the town.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqu26JNQZB0jCcVDC18PKQ__original/img/H66R4AERgf5JoiefCgm195rujzg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6422235.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pqu26JNQZB0jCcVDC18PKQ__thumb/img/R4WLcRpALnl-PJyq7Cvyh0dX2cc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6422235.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":9999,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Role Playing","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9,"rank":-1,"designers":["Brendan McCaskell","Nathan Lige"],"publishers":["OOMM"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
