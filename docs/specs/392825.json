{"gameId":392825,"name":"Garden Guests","description":"In Garden Guests, players compete to form a continuous path across a garden board that features beautiful paper cut art.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player on a team &mdash; a team can be one or multiple players &mdash; can draw cards, give cards to a teammate, or use their cards to build a tower or extend their path. Towers are necessary in order to create a path between your base and a tower, or from one tower to another &mdash; but if you haven't yet connected a tower to your path, your opponents can take it if they have cards to make a larger tower.&#10;&#10;To make a path, a player must play cards that match the colors of each space in the path. Once a path is made, it is permanent, and your opponent may have to wind their own path around yours.&#10;&#10;The first team to make a path all the way across the board wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0laMmGJPRd9KC0NUtvW20A__original/img/CeTf4DB8HEF5k38ouQrqbOy9tzc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7583531.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0laMmGJPRd9KC0NUtvW20A__thumb/img/e4vMdf3Am7B0Lu_AZrRh6gkjOJQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7583531.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Communication Limits","Hexagon Grid","Team-Based Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.52388,"averageRating":6.79787,"rank":16175,"designers":["Stephen Glenn"],"publishers":["Van Ryder Games"],"artists":["Kristena Derrick"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
