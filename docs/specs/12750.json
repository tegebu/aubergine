{"gameId":12750,"name":"1860: Railways on the Isle of Wight","description":"A game tracing the development of railways on the Isle of Wight, 1860 is part of the 18xx series of economic railway games, based on Francis Tresham's original concepts.&#10;&#10;The game is notable for the small size of the board compared to many 18xx games, and its innovative game end: The climax of play sees the beginnings of railway nationalization in the United Kingdom, with the weakest companies being eliminated from private operation earlier than those which are the healthiest.&#10;&#10;The game was initially produced in a small print run of c.100 copies.  JKLM and Z-Man games released a larger, but still limited, 2nd edition (with an alternate map) in 2010.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VVehvyR-9kb_Kht7gS0s5w__original/img/BPWYEnsxhNyiitalWv7Bud-7WH4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic143735.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VVehvyR-9kb_Kht7gS0s5w__thumb/img/d6FmUYCHu03N97tYTimmLwcEiMQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic143735.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":240,"mechanics":["Auction/Bidding","Network and Route Building","Stock Holding","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2004,"bggRating":6.2129,"averageRating":7.96989,"rank":1662,"designers":["Mike Hutton"],"publishers":["JKLM Games","Z-Man Games, Inc."],"artists":["Mike Hutton"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":15,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":4,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
