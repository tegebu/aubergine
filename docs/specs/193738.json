{"gameId":193738,"name":"Great Western Trail","description":"America in the 19th century: You are a rancher and repeatedly herd your cattle from Texas to Kansas City, where you send them off by train. This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the &quot;Great Western Trail&quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&#10;&#10;If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u1l0gH7sb_vnvDvoO_QHqA__original/img/2zv_XMQoPFWk9Dn0oS4JY1IeFzw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4887376.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u1l0gH7sb_vnvDvoO_QHqA__thumb/img/9lxFidyDb8j6D1vobx4e3UwZ-FI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4887376.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Ownership","Point to Point Movement","Rondel","Set Collection","Track Movement","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2016,"bggRating":8.11856,"averageRating":8.28799,"rank":12,"designers":["Alexander Pfister"],"publishers":["eggertspiele","999 Games","Arclight","Broadway Toys LTD","Conclave Editora","Delta Vision Publishing","Ediciones MasQueOca","Gigamic","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Lacerta","Ludicus","MINDOK","Pegasus Spiele","Plan B Games","Stronghold Games","uplay.it edizioni","YOKA Games","Zvezda"],"artists":["Andreas Resch"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":50,"notRecommended":373,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":126,"recommended":462,"notRecommended":52,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":468,"recommended":166,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":174,"recommended":338,"notRecommended":89,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":339,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
