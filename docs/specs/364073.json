{"gameId":364073,"name":"Splendor Duel","description":"Confront your rival guild in a race for victory. Take Gem and Pearl tokens from the common board, then purchase cards, gather bonuses, royal favours, and prestige.&#10;&#10;Discover new twists and strategic opportunities derived from Splendor, the original best-selling game. Acquire cards with impressive powers, take advantage of special Privileges, and fight over scarce access to Pearls.&#10;&#10;Splendor Duel is a two-player only standalone game based on Splendor that retains some of the main gameplay mechanisms of that design, while being a bit more complex, dynamic, interactive, rich, tense, and mean.&#10;&#10;The game features a main board shared by both opponents, card powers, and three victory conditions.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V1PyFDPNFY4bJFgreLPxmQ__original/img/NelFMJToi6WYyDQheBZiwCP7-qE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6929347.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V1PyFDPNFY4bJFgreLPxmQ__thumb/img/E0OuG2X4HsbOdCh1uLyZZcMiapQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6929347.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":[],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.94434,"averageRating":7.89379,"rank":2975,"designers":["Marc Andr√©","Bruno Cathala"],"publishers":["Space Cowboys","Asmodee Italia","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Rebel Sp. z o.o."],"artists":["Davide Tosello"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":9,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
