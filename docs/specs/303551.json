{"gameId":303551,"name":"Polis","description":"Polis&nbsp;is a two-player civ-lite game set in the beginning of the conflict between the two major poleis of the 5th century B.C: Athens and the Delian League against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. The winner will be the Empire with more population and prestige at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Both players must secure their supplies and the routes to five markets to trade with them. Every turn you get goods from a territory where you have population supporting your Empire, but you should feed them.&#10;&#10;You can fight to control the territories and siege other polis or you might use your diplomacy to convince a polis to join your league. But polis are proud of their independence so you will have to create some projects to gain prestige needed for your military manoeuvres.&#10;&#10;This new edition of Polis has updated revised rules and new art that will enhance your game experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sR9vKUFfimiNWW7dOSkBMg__original/img/RNYk3JfdCaMmsTGatAqn5onZPBs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5264401.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sR9vKUFfimiNWW7dOSkBMg__thumb/img/rg7Lwz8yf4l11GEPXGF7ACHsBSg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5264401.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Simulation","Variable Phase Order","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.84235,"averageRating":8.51775,"rank":3365,"designers":["Fran Diaz"],"publishers":["Devir Games"],"artists":["Enrique Corominas"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":8,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
