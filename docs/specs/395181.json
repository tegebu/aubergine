{"gameId":395181,"name":"Farms Race","description":"Radioactive waste from local power plants has granted you and your fellow farm animals both sentience and an insatiable hunger... for power. Now you must take up the weapons of your former masters, the humans, to fight both them and each other for control of the countryside.&#10;&#10;Farms Race is a 1.5-2 hour strategy game that parodies Eurogames like Catan and Agricola. Players play as the Supreme Leader of a species of farm animal racing to accumulate 10 Victory Points by building Barns and Armories, recruiting Spies, building the most nukes, and conquering opponents' regions with their herds.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/80IdN1JGESNiu4LmJqz8oQ__original/img/TRBd8RF-3WLk1w5Tn2ffzezx4H8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7663798.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/80IdN1JGESNiu4LmJqz8oQ__thumb/img/yXMDpPMhX4-8VMYWUvCWb--uLLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7663798.png","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Alliances","Bribery","Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid","Hidden Victory Points","Modular Board","Moving Multiple Units","Negotiation","Take That","Trading","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.6,"rank":-1,"designers":["Daniel Dranove","Tom Weiner"],"publishers":["Medium Brow Games"],"artists":["Michael Zhang"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
