{"gameId":275215,"name":"Namiji","description":"In Namiji, you are fishers from the Japan of yesteryear, navigating south of the Japanese archipelago, a few kilometers from the famous Tokaido road. You will need to have a fruitful day at sea to win the game.&#10;&#10;To do this, you will have the opportunity to contemplate magnificent marine species, to fish with a line or a net to fill your racks with colorful fish, and haul in your crustacean traps.&#10;&#10;You can benefit from stops to improve your fishing equipment, and you will also have to contend with the gods of the sea by setting offerings afloat, or by fulfilling their wishes that they express during your contemplation with the Sacred Rocks, for which they will reward you.&#10;&#10;Namiji features gameplay similar to Tokaido. The action spaces are laid out on the game board in a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces. What players are doing on the track differs from what they do in Tokaido.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AW6IWjNVwOOLxVHepkQk1g__original/img/vrWnwd7-67YNTr4XFra222jO3Sk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4629265.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AW6IWjNVwOOLxVHepkQk1g__thumb/img/pDLMyt8zz2ga13wKW0ayyjVRkOw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4629265.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Set Collection","Track Movement","Turn Order: Time Track","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.07452,"averageRating":7.06878,"rank":2545,"designers":["Antoine Bauza"],"publishers":["Funforge","Hobby Japan","Pegasus Spiele"],"artists":["Xavier Gueniffey Durin"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":13,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
