{"gameId":131682,"name":"City of Gears","description":"City of Gears is a unique steampunk game of exploration, area control, worker placement, and engine building. From your incredible Factory, you must race to claim ownership over the magnificent ruins of an abandoned clockwork metropolis. Each game plays in under an hour, and because only nine of the city tiles (from dozens available) are randomly chosen and placed each game, no two games ever play the same.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you roll a number of production dice and activate City Tiles, then you move your automaton workers and perform a variety of actions (such as drawing and placing gears to reactivate areas of the city, sabotaging opponents, and activating unique steam powers) as determined by your resources. Along the way, you will develop your Factory with special powers which set it apart and provide you with powerful bonuses.&#10;&#10;As the city is revealed and its abilities are discovered, players must concoct plans to accrue prestige and hinder opponents so that once Opening Day arrives, they will emerge victorious! Do you have what it takes to set the City of Gears in motion?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S1OGGwT4B9W1D-Xuauo-uw__original/img/HmCcYZpVmZcfAiggDOpWL41eppc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4009722.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S1OGGwT4B9W1D-Xuauo-uw__thumb/img/OY4YkmMw9TZzn6PB7N_oAyyNMOk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4009722.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Take That","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2012,"bggRating":5.82308,"averageRating":6.55457,"rank":4132,"designers":["Chris Leder","Daryl Andrews"],"publishers":["Grey Fox Games","(Self-Published)"],"artists":["Anthony Cournoyer","Chris Leder","Tyler Myatt"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":6,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":9,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
