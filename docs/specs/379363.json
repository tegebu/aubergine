{"gameId":379363,"name":"Castellans of Valeria","description":"In Castellans of Valeria, players will compete to build the most impressive jurisdictions in the city of Kosk with hopes of becoming its next Castellan &mdash; but this is no easy task! It requires players to navigate the complexities of construction, to pit short-term gains against long-term goals, and to decide between the assurance of small payoffs now or the possibility of larger payoffs later. As construction continues, the local Magistrate wanders each district of Kosk, casting judgement upon everyone's work at different times. Will you out-smart other players and gain the Magistrate's favor? Will you do enough in the big picture &mdash; and at the right times &mdash; to pull off the victory? Only time will tell in Castellans of Valeria!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H0C78S2mOp0HBBUSjIG3CQ__original/img/HA9Cdx5daXjWZ13GGsS12CYkLPY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7335428.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H0C78S2mOp0HBBUSjIG3CQ__thumb/img/nOLQsJfUJVzVNqtZFwnfyJiaiEk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7335428.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":[],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.7,"rank":-1,"designers":["Isaias Vallejo"],"publishers":["Daily Magic Games"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
