Spies will shore up your plans, vital contracts will expand your resources, or you can learn the ways of the Fremen and ride mighty sandworms into battle!&#10;&#10;Dune: Imperium Uprising is a standalone spinoff to Dune: Imperium that expands on that game's blend of deck-building and worker placement, while introducing a new six-player mode that pits two teams against one other in the biggest struggle yet.&#10;&#10;The Dune: Imperium expansions Rise of Ix and Immortality work with Uprising, as do almost all of the cards from the base game, and elements of Uprising can be used with Dune: Imperium.&#10;&#10;The choices are yours. The Imperium awaits!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UVUkjMV_Q2paVUIUP30Vvw__original/img/BoUtCkd1NRO0bR1R5EwL51xIuXA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7664424.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UVUkjMV_Q2paVUIUP30Vvw__thumb/img/H6qmxJrRFjtOAPZOfDoZ480-46I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7664424.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Automatic Resource Growth","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Delayed Purchase","Force Commitment","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Multi-Use Cards","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Team-Based Game","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":8.11045,"averageRating":8.72252,"rank":12,"designers":["Paul Dennen"],"publishers":["Dire Wolf","Arclight Games","Galápagos Jogos","Geekach Games","Korea Boardgames","Lavka Games","Lucky Duck Games","Reflexshop","Regatul Jocurilor","REXhry","Tabletop KZ"],"artists":["Clay Brooks","Derek Herring","Raul Ramos","Nate Storm"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":15,"recommended":101,"notRecommended":73,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":12,"recommended":119,"notRecommended":74,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":100,"recommended":137,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":221,"recommended":53,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":174,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":40,"recommended":99,"notRecommended":35,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":125,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
