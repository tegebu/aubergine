{"gameId":367518,"name":"Imperium: Horizons","description":"Formidable adversaries are arrayed against you. Your people stand ready. History beckons.&#10;&#10;In your hands lies the destiny of one of most storied peoples of history. Under constant threat of attack, you must conquer new lands, oversee dramatic scientific and cultural advances, and lead your people into the era of empire. Expand too rapidly and unrest will bring your civilization to its knees; build up too slowly, and you might find yourself a mere footnote of history. As one of fourteen radically asymmetric civilizations, you will compete to become the most dominant empire the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Imperium: Horizons is a standalone game that contains an astonishing fourteen unique civilizations, each of which makes for a unique and challenging opponent in a solo game. The game is fully compatible with Imperium: Classics and Imperium: Legends for players wanting to expand their pool of civilizations even further, and the game incorporates a new trade module that allows players to recreate all the intrigue, wealth generation, and dynamic politics of a thriving economy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RonhJsZOe0QOj-fzkgEf0g__original/img/DxjJMKLtdZzzDOaacaitwfkRLJU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6993187.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RonhJsZOe0QOj-fzkgEf0g__thumb/img/FMrHdCcRlTrwgMlRXLq5pDONuVE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6993187.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":160,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Market","Move Through Deck","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":10,"rank":-1,"designers":["Nigel Buckle","DÃ¡vid Turczi"],"publishers":["Osprey Games"],"artists":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
