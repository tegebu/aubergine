{"gameId":367518,"name":"Imperium: Horizons","description":"Formidable adversaries are arrayed against you. Your people stand ready. History beckons.&#10;&#10;In your hands lies the destiny of one of the most storied peoples of history. Under constant threat of attack, you must conquer new lands, oversee dramatic scientific and cultural advances, and lead your people into the era of empire. Expand too rapidly and unrest will bring your civilisation to its knees; build up too slowly, however, and you might find yourself a mere footnote of history. As one of fourteen radically asymmetric civilisations, you will compete to become the most dominant empire the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Imperium: Horizons is a standalone game that contains the Abbasid, Askumite, Cultist, Gupta, Inuit, Japanese, Magyar, Martian, Mayan, Polynesian, Sassanid, Taino, Tang, and Wagadou civilisations. Each makes for a unique and challenging opponent in both multiplayer and solo games.&#10;&#10;Fully compatible with Imperium: Classics and Imperium: Legends for those wanting to expand their pool of civilisations even further, Imperium: Horizons also incorporates a new trade module that allows players to recreate all the intrigue, wealth generation, and dynamic politics of a thriving economy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RonhJsZOe0QOj-fzkgEf0g__original/img/DxjJMKLtdZzzDOaacaitwfkRLJU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6993187.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RonhJsZOe0QOj-fzkgEf0g__thumb/img/FMrHdCcRlTrwgMlRXLq5pDONuVE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6993187.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":160,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Market","Move Through Deck","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.54509,"averageRating":8.81892,"rank":12237,"designers":["Nigel Buckle","DÃ¡vid Turczi"],"publishers":["Osprey Games"],"artists":["Mihajlo Dimitrievski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
