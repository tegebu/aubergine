{"gameId":231581,"name":"AuZtralia","description":"AuZtralia is an adventure/exploration game for 1-4 players set in an alternate reality 1930s. The theme is inspired by Martin Wallace's A Study in Emerald. Following the Restorationist war, the northern hemisphere lands lay poisoned and starvation was the norm. Intrepid adventurers set out to explore and settle new lands. Little did they know, after the war, the surviving Old Ones and their remaining loyal human armies made their way to the outback of Australia to lick their wounds.&#10;&#10;Build a port, construct railways, mine and farm for food. You&rsquo;ll need to prepare for the awakening. You&rsquo;ll need to fight.&#10;&#10;Everything you do in the game costs time, which is one of AuZtralia's most valued resources.&#10;&#10;At a point in time, the Old Ones will wake up and become an active player. They begin to reveal themselves and move, with potentially devastating outcomes.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need to prepare wisely for the awakening and may have to co-operate with others to defeat the most dangerous Old Ones.&#10;&#10;Military units will help you to locate, fight and defend against the nightmarish beings that may be lurking on your doorstep. As well as hardware, you&rsquo;ll need to recruit some Personalities who have the skills and resources to help you.&#10;&#10;Riches from the land, mixed with darkness and insanity await you in the outback. Will humanity prevail or will the Old Ones wreak their revenge?&#10;&#10;&#10;By default, the game is semi-cooperative, where one wins or everyone loses. The rulebook includes a fully cooperative variant.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ejsIlS4INZ23Zyd1oQd5GA__original/img/j6q9x1oUF7jI6Pl_7RwWcWJGpCE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4144485.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ejsIlS4INZ23Zyd1oQd5GA__thumb/img/LhEU5iotxrQHpdt0hBAeQ3X5Al4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4144485.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Cooperative Game","Hexagon Grid","Network and Route Building","Solo / Solitaire Game","Sudden Death Ending","Time Track"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":6.74615,"averageRating":7.40373,"rank":663,"designers":["Martin Wallace"],"publishers":["SchilMil Games, Ltd.","Ediciones MasQueOca","Giochix.it","Ludofy Creative","Nuts!
