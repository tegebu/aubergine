{"gameId":403409,"name":"Knight","description":"A flip&amp;write game in which we play the role of a medieval knight. During the game, by building a network of influence in the royal court and by developing our character, we gain the ability to influence the actions in a given scenario - we take part in warfare, expansion of the kingdom, election of a new lords, fight against plague or flood, etc. In each turn of the game we draw 6 cards which mean what will happen in that turn. We receive a certain pool of resources, determine which action will be active and (in solo mode) what the consequences will be (that is, the actions of the automata). The game consists of 2 rounds, in each of which we deal 6 cards, at the end of the each 3 turns we also deal goal card conditions which determine the rewards and penalties for each achievement.&#10;&#10;The player wins if he meets certain scenario objectives-there are always several ways to win (e.g., scoring a certain amount of points or fulfilling a given objective like occupying the entire map or winning a certain number of battles). The player can also lose the game before all the turns are over if the conditions for losing specified in the scenario are met (e.g. the enemy occupies the entire map or attacks an undefended castle).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v0oCTbbhvSbb1MD2tKjQNA__original/img/KM-K9qegCuTGjFA7_jCB8C9LvA4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7862684.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v0oCTbbhvSbb1MD2tKjQNA__thumb/img/AIW6uiqeY8u8BVG4jcxMvCmlcwY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7862684.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Paper-and-Pencil","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.83333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Radosław Ignatów"],"publishers":["Hammerdice"],"artists":["Michał Teliga"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
