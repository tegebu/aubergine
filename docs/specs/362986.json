But be careful! The effect or even the possibility of playing the card may vary depending on...the back of your surrounding opponents'cards.&#10;Players may also send their wind riders to explore the area, plant forests or build villages and temples using all the gathered ressources.&#10;&#10;Along the game, you will manage to complete some objectives that will allow you to unlock your guide's special abilities, and to improve your tribes' powers.&#10;&#10;When someone builds their 5th village, the game will be about to end. The player with the most points, depending on pollution, villages, temples, layout of their forests and other various objectives, will be the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G_moxnKfgJ4w_NGmr9T6Lg__original/img/SFbumPuv8QNYm2UT5ZiHye0Zv-k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6871609.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/G_moxnKfgJ4w_NGmr9T6Lg__thumb/img/YBNaQ6O-D_ej8czfA3okABmfQjg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6871609.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Grid Coverage","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.56158,"averageRating":8.10766,"rank":9820,"designers":["Joachim Thôme"],"publishers":["La Boîte de Jeu"],"artists":["Vincent Dutrait"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
