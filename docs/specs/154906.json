{"gameId":154906,"name":"Isle of Trains","description":"In Isle of Trains, players are train operators, building trains with the right mix of freight cars needed to complete delivery contracts before your opponents.&#10;&#10;Cards are used in multiple ways: they can be built as train cars or buildings supporting your train line, used as currency to pay the cost of building those new train cars and buildings, or used as cargo to load on available train cars.&#10;&#10;When loading cargo on an opponent&rsquo;s train, players receive an immediate benefit or action, but they are also giving their opponent the cargo they just might need to be able to complete a delivery contract and score big!&#10;&#10;Balancing the need to upgrade your train, take advantage of benefits from loading other players' trains, and complete delivery contracts first is the key to being the most successful train operator on the Isle of Trains!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tzEq9B-ZsUaR6ck5-S49BA__original/img/mB-obAYqX8oSuJjaAh2aAW-wUS8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1951594.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tzEq9B-ZsUaR6ck5-S49BA__thumb/img/ItASwe8Jixi4F82eefROIPHbaD8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1951594.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Contracts","Hand Management","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2014,"bggRating":6.10178,"averageRating":6.77519,"rank":2174,"designers":["Seth Jaffee","Dan Keltner"],"publishers":["Dice Hate Me Games","Lookout Games","Looping Games"],"artists":["Daniel Guidera","Christopher Kirkman"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":12,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
