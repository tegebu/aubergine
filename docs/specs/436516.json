{"gameId":436516,"name":"Merchants of Andromeda","description":"In Merchants of Andromeda, you have to play the game of space politics, casting votes in the Senate, bidding on lucrative space goods, or resorting to ship combat!&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you draw three cards (one at a time), choosing one each to discard (which grants you a resource), keep (which grants you an action), or auction (which grants the winner both an action and a resource). To perform the Dutch auction in this game, use either a timer or the game's dedicated app &mdash; the more the timer ticks down, the less the winner will pay. Through these cards, you'll manipulate the market, play intergalactic mini-games, and resolve events. In the end, the player with the most money wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GINqipWTQ4BdR-zC-LLbPg__original/img/TDDgT-cRfVDDWJPaXYQUNTbQYWY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8634817.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GINqipWTQ4BdR-zC-LLbPg__thumb/img/nDmHL2bzCA9DVSDzra9_QdpbAL0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8634817.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Auction: Dutch","Events","Voting"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.83333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["Allplay"],"artists":["Torben BÃ¶kemeyer"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
