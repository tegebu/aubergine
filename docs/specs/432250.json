{"gameId":432250,"name":"52 Realms: Adventures","description":"Across the 52 realms light and darkness exist in a fragile equilibrium. As an adventurer for hire, your mission is simple: protect the light by venturing into the shadowy places that few dare to tread. Of course, it&rsquo;s not all honorable deeds and heroic quests. The dark places also contain untold riches for those brave enough to seek them out...&#10;&#10;52 Realms: Adventures is a new solo print at home game from the designers of Voyages, Aquamarine and Waypoints. Armed with a standard 52 card deck, you&rsquo;ll venture into a dungeon, choosing one of many paths to face off against a final boss. Each dungeon map is contained on a single sheet of A4 or Letter paper with one additional sheet used for tracking items, wounds and equipment on your character. As with all of our games, there is no crafting required, and you&rsquo;ll just need three markers (e.g. coins or cubes) and a deck of playing cards to play the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X24nY57W6ccHrouGcPjfBA__original/img/Ye365cMMJ9mcakKvO89yLSiUwVw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8519055.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X24nY57W6ccHrouGcPjfBA__thumb/img/Iv4SOMDLUdbIyRqtCemffbEHghk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8519055.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Card Play Conflict Resolution","Hand Management","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.62036,"averageRating":7.69231,"rank":7992,"designers":["Matthew Dunstan","Rory Muldoon"],"publishers":["Postmark Games"],"artists":["Rory Muldoon"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
