Build your army, fill your deck with powerful spells and actions, explore caves and dungeons, and eventually conquer powerful cities controlled by this once-great faction!

Solo rules are also included.&#10;&#10;Combining elements of RPGs, deck-building, and traditional board games the Mage Knight board game captures the rich history of the Mage Knight universe in a self-contained gaming experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DUO2hz9AlLOH8p9ED-lCWg__original/img/PDDH38Vf9NEB_4ODURxcJKNBfVQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1083380.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DUO2hz9AlLOH8p9ED-lCWg__thumb/img/0bWDfnjzYebauQZrHmjyHkuUttI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1083380.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":240,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Cooperative Game","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Role Playing","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2011,"bggRating":7.88192,"averageRating":8.09968,"rank":27,"designers":["Vlaada Chvátil"],"publishers":["WizKids","Asmodee","Giochi Uniti","Intrafin Games","Lacerta","NECA","Pegasus Spiele","REXhry"],"artists":["J.
