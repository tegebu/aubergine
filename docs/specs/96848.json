Build your army, fill your deck with powerful spells and actions, explore caves and dungeons, and eventually conquer powerful cities controlled by this once-great faction!  In competitive scenarios, opposing players may be powerful allies, but only one will be able to claim the land as their own.  In cooperative scenarios, the players win or lose as a group.  Solo rules are also included.&#10;&#10;Combining elements of RPGs, deck-building, and traditional board games the Mage Knight board game captures the rich history of the Mage Knight universe in a self-contained gaming experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DUO2hz9AlLOH8p9ED-lCWg__original/img/PDDH38Vf9NEB_4ODURxcJKNBfVQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1083380.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DUO2hz9AlLOH8p9ED-lCWg__thumb/img/0bWDfnjzYebauQZrHmjyHkuUttI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1083380.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":240,"mechanics":["Card Play Conflict Resolution","Cooperative Game","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Multi-Use Cards","Open Drafting","Role Playing","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Claim Action","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2011,"bggRating":7.85448,"averageRating":8.08574,"rank":34,"designers":["Vlaada Chvátil"],"publishers":["WizKids (I)","Asmodee","Giochi Uniti","Intrafin Games","Lacerta","NECA","Pegasus Spiele","REXhry"],"artists":["J.
