{"gameId":296100,"name":"Rococo: Deluxe Edition","description":"Welcome to the Rococo era. Louis XV reigns in France, and it's the height of fashion to attend his lavish balls where important luminaries dress up in extravagant gowns and fancy frock coats, all eager to surpass one another in elegance and grace. In just a few weeks, Louis XV is hosting the final Grand Ball of the season, and everyone is clamoring for you to provide them with an elegant frock coat here, a sumptuous gown there, or even a small sum to fund the great fireworks display. You quickly realize that it's not just about your tailoring business anymore; it's about creating a presence at the most prestigious ball of the era and the chance to gain everlasting fame and prestige.&#10;&#10;In Rococo: Deluxe Edition, you are the owner of a distinguished tailoring business endeavoring to increase your prestige. Each turn, you play an employee card that allows you to perform a task, such as hiring a new employee for your staff, tailoring exquisite gowns and frock coats to rent or sell, or funding some of the many decorations. However, employees are not always able to perform all tasks, so you must plan carefully how you direct them, especially as each employee grants a unique bonus &mdash; including some that generate prestige.&#10;&#10;The Grand Ball ends after seven rounds with a huge fireworks display and final scoring. You will gain prestige points for the sumptuous gowns and frock coats you have rented out to guests at the ball, certain employee bonuses, and the festive decorations you have funded. Whoever has collected the most prestige at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Rococo: Deluxe Edition contains the previously released Jewelry Box expansion, the Festivity Dresses expansion, and the Fancy Dresses promo, as well as a new &quot;Madame du Barry&quot; solo mode expansion. This version of Rococo features changes from the previous edition of the base game, along with premium components including custom poly-resin lace and thread tokens; gold foil heat-stamped, wooden player markers; velveteen cloth bags for garments, silk and jewelry tokens; and upgraded punch boards for the garments, silk, and coins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1fjJb9ELv-x-3aCWV7vxIQ__original/img/qlpCqN7YAwFAL7lpN-Bs7MOjKxo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5132725.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1fjJb9ELv-x-3aCWV7vxIQ__thumb/img/ObIoNaNaCfgo4DkZpdUiFL-6RAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5132725.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Card Drafting","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":6.21399,"averageRating":8.44654,"rank":-1,"designers":["Matthias Cramer","Stefan Malz","Louis Malz"],"publishers":["Eagle-Gryphon Games","Geekach Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Maldito Games","Mosaico Jogos","Skellig Games","YOKA Games"],"artists":["Ian O'Toole"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":11,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
