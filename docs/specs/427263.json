{"gameId":427263,"name":"Line of Fire: Burnt Moon","description":"A group of black-hat hackers known as POSIWID plots to hijack the moon Io and hold the entire Jovian power grid to ransom. Standing in their way are the ultra-corporate LFA, the constructors of the lunar energy facilities. Both sides have engaged a fleet of ROV &ndash; advanced remotely-operated robots &mdash; to battle across the treacherous landscape.&#10;&#10;The machines are activated. Initiate combat sequence. The battle for Io has begun.&#10;&#10;Line of Fire: Burnt Moon is a standalone two-player card game that fuses the lean deck-building of the award-winning Undaunted series with fast-paced lane battling. Sharp decision-making and clever positioning combine in a nail-bitingly tense, endlessly replayable, and lightning-fast experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WgfoxbddW8PvTNL5OlMw7Q__original/img/fHw3Bf0dCRlLKPJsimmEj8-YXyI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8441769.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WgfoxbddW8PvTNL5OlMw7Q__thumb/img/SNCapTekhXqwCKfZHRLkAnGvzKg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8441769.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.39048,"rank":-1,"designers":["Trevor Benjamin","David Thompson (I)"],"publishers":["Osprey Games"],"artists":["LÃ©onard Dupond"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
