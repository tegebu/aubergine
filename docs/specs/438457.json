{"gameId":438457,"name":"Push Push Penguin","description":"In Push Push Penguin, you will compete in a race filled with slides, snacks, and seals.&#10;&#10;But there is a catch! An Orca approaches, and it will chase away the first penguin to cross paths with it &ndash; so the Penguin who finishes second in this race is the winner!&#10;&#10;To play, all players roll their Penguin Dice. Players use their Penguin Cup to shake their dice and hide them. They secretly select which of their dice they want to use for movement then reveal the dice at the same time. Starting with whoever has the Orca Die, each player takes a turn gobbling up fish and moving their penguin. They push any penguins they land on or interact with special spaces. After all players have taken their turn, the player with the Orca Die rolls it and moves the Orca.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the Orca moves onto a Penguin&rsquo;s space and the Penguin is not able to gobble up fish tokens to keep from being scared away by the Orca.&#10;&#10;The player with the penguin in second place wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cSggjBHBmTsqcwG7YQfCyw__original/img/0EiI0V2OLkUmCsF1LstH3EHbq_E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8693197.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cSggjBHBmTsqcwG7YQfCyw__thumb/img/0gA9vhC2nEGbhMKriXTmSm3yq9g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8693197.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Race","Roll / Spin and Move"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.23,"rank":-1,"designers":["Christopher Ryan Chan","David Gordon (I)","TAM"],"publishers":["Wacky Wizard Games"],"artists":["Christopher Ryan Chan"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
