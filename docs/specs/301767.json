{"gameId":301767,"name":"Mysterium Park","description":"Welcome to Mysterium Park!&#10;Its cotton candies, its circus, its dark secrets...&#10;The park&rsquo;s former director has disappeared, but the investigation came to nothing. Since that night, weird things are happening on the fairground. As psychics, you&rsquo;re convinced that a ghost haunts this carnival... You&rsquo;re now intent on giving it a chance to reveal the truth.&#10;In this cooperative stand-alone game, the ghost sends visions with illustrated cards. The psychics try to interpret them in order to rule out certain suspects and locations. Then, they&rsquo;ll seize their only chance to piece together what happened to the director. You have only six nights before the carnival leaves town... Open your minds and find the truth!&#10;Set in the lights of a 1950's US fairground, Mysterium Park shares the same core mechanism with the famous award-winning game it reimplements, though bringing a different approach: it is smaller and faster, thanks to very quick setup and simplified rules.&#10;Mysterium is a milestone in immersive and eye-catching experiences close to role-playing; with Mysterium Park, you can enjoy the heart of it in a more condensed way.&#10;Mysterium Park will be released at the end of 2020.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/kGH9qAWYh418mWK9uHtCTZFehws=/0x0/pic5581038.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bTRB0-Qnb-tvrYxN3vJJZRBEZ1s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5581038.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Pattern Recognition","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Storytelling"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.55191,"averageRating":7.90033,"rank":9596,"designers":["Oleksandr Nevskiy","Oleg Sidorenko"],"publishers":["Libellud","Asmodee"],"artists":["Xavier Collette","M81 Studio"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
