Each month players take turns placing workers on the gameboard to take actions like removing trees, building concessions and attractions, and buying more property in order to make their growing theme parks as attractive to visiting people (VP tokens) as possible. At the end of each month, rewards are given to the player with the fairground that best exemplifies certain raw emotions, and after five months the player with the most VP tokens wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-e6f1-cht9Proly7cjsM9g__original/img/Z6OKDCmjl_dzbcheAVi8g87Ys0k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6175532.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-e6f1-cht9Proly7cjsM9g__thumb/img/MwQw3KPh6U-tuZHw4qml9kVfisA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6175532.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":75,"mechanics":["Income","Set Collection","Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.26133,"rank":-1,"designers":["Nate Linhart"],"publishers":["Thunderworks Games"],"artists":["Vincent Dutrait"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
