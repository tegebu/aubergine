{"gameId":323156,"name":"Stroganov","description":"In the 16th century, Russia began to expand eastwards to develop the vast expanses of Siberia. This phase in history is closely associated with the name &quot;Stroganov&quot;.&#10;&#10;In the game Stroganov, players try to collect the best furs to gain wealth and fame as they move across the vastness that is Siberia. They will journey through Siberia in spring, summer, and autumn before returning home each winter. After four years (rounds), the player who has best utilized their actions and collected the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Each year, the players must move eastward across the landscape. They can spend horses if they wish to travel further. Once they have advanced, they may take a basic action, such as trading or collecting furs or coins. Lastly, they may take more advanced actions such as visiting a village, setting up a yurt, taking a Tsar's wish (card), setting up a hunting lodge, or buying a landscape field. All of these actions &mdash; combined with exploring and some storytelling along the way &mdash; earn players victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Every winter, players return home to Tyumen to prepare for a new year.&#10;&#10;After four years, the game ends, then players score victory points based on having collected the right landscape tiles, fulfilled the Tsar's wishes, built hunting lodges, collected furs, and more.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o7CUpHZLvw5vuwRCqPZMHw__original/img/Em35adNA6vzdSSdQ74HUazuMkUY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5827215.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o7CUpHZLvw5vuwRCqPZMHw__thumb/img/ieOsIj7QyKes1F5jw8bJsXFyl3M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5827215.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Movement","Map Addition","Point to Point Movement","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Turn Order: Claim Action","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.31056,"averageRating":7.30746,"rank":1579,"designers":["Andreas Steding"],"publishers":["Game Brewer","Abi Games","Board Game Rookie","Czacha Games","Delta Vision Publishing","Geronimo Games","Giochix.it","Grok Games","Lotus Frog Games","Maldito Games","TLAMA games"],"artists":["Maciej Janik"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":27,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":28,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":10,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
