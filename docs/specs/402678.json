{"gameId":402678,"name":"Fritanga","description":"Set in the Blind Business universe, Fritanga is a game for cooking lovers where the playing area is - a fryer! Players take control of various foods and try to survive at all costs, jumping from one side of the fryer basket to the other. When a player cannot move, they fall into the boiling oil, being fried, and (unfortunately) eliminated from the game. You must use all the cards you collect to survive and not become deliciously battered.&#10;&#10;Fritanga has three game modes: free-for-all, suitable for 3 to 7 players; the mode against the chef, a semi-co-operative version for groups of 3 to 7 players, in which one will be the chef and will try to fry the rest of the players; and team mode, in which two equal groups compete to win. Each game mode has a few different cards to tailor the experience.&#10;&#10;After assembling the central board with cards, which represent spaces on the fryer grid, players begin their turns, which are divided into two phases: playing cards and moving. The first phase allows you to play as many cards as you want, with the aim of improving the position in the fryer or annoying and attacking your rivals. The second phase allows you to move 1-2 cards away. At that moment, the card you reached is revealed, then either an effect is triggered or you can claim that card to use it later.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuA6Q760e-7FPO85kV20zQ__original/img/tXZnU-CZ_uK6DojgVBK9wCRxS0g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8495326.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuA6Q760e-7FPO85kV20zQ__thumb/img/i-KDu9ip1gV9eFxCv6PfezDeAnk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8495326.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":7,"playingTime":25,"mechanics":["Semi-Cooperative Game","Team-Based Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.48538,"averageRating":4.71562,"rank":26549,"designers":["Jos√© Luchoro","Rafael Miralles"],"publishers":["Devir"],"artists":["Meeple Foundry","Carlos Ureta"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
