{"gameId":330510,"name":"Yucatan","description":"In Yucatan, you are the leader of a Mayan city. You have promised your people to win the favors of the Gods, and their fate is in your hands. Send your warlords to capture enemies, increase your might with every season of the sacred calendar, and sacrifice your prisoners to the Mayan gods to ensure your dominance.&#10;&#10;Your warlords will become more and more formidable, your city more and more glorious, but your opponents do the same, so enlisting the help of the mythological creatures and heroes will be necessary to try to restore with blood, the energy of your gods.&#10;&#10;In this game, your goal is to capture prisoners, and the Yucatan peninsula is your playground. Prepare for four seasons of fierce fighting. At the end of each season, you will ritually sacrifice captured enemies to gain reputation, but be careful because the gods are demanding: Each of your sacrifices must be more glorious than the last. Each decision matters in the subtle balance required to make your city the glorious and eternal sanctuary of the mighty Mayan gods.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L_xY9iVkV6sXrssfuVHrHw__original/img/RBWzVTBkgJYUkV0y_gw1cRo_6EU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6034600.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L_xY9iVkV6sXrssfuVHrHw__thumb/img/1Q3vzstFAewTYpsXyIRB0j3QniE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6034600.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.1,"rank":-1,"designers":["Guillaume Montiage"],"publishers":["Matagot"],"artists":["Karl Fitzgerald"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
