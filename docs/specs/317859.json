While you are growing your trees across the vast and barren lands of Pangaia, you must complete a series of rituals to honor Mother Nature. Those rituals unleash Gaia&rsquo;s energy of LIFE and are the beginning of the endless cycle of growth and decay.&#10;In Forests of Pangaia you grow your own forest and contend with other players for territory.
