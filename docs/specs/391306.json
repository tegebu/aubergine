{"gameId":391306,"name":"Defenders of the Realm: Legends Edition","description":"The last decade has been an unprecedented age of prosperity, peace, and growth across the known realm. We have not known a tranquility like this in all our recorded history. The young have no conception of what life was like during the war against the Dark Lord, and they are far better for it. However, this peace balances unsteadily on a knife&rsquo;s edge. The shadow of evil grows tall and long. Rumors of dragons come from the far reaches. Goblins organize into roving bands. The dead stir in the dust of long-forgotten battlefields. The scent of sulfur and brimstone permeates the air to the south, bringing with it a dread promise of demons.&#10;&#10;Ancient tomes in the libraries of Monarch City tell us one thing: the shattering of our peace is upon us.&#10;&#10;Defenders of the Realm: Legends Edition is a fresh take on the co-operative fantasy classic. Be the heroes who adventure together across the land to destroy the forces of darkness. The game features six unique heroes, each with a unique deck as well as variable player powers. Manage your hand as the more cards you play, the more resources you give to the enemy. Save Monarch City from crushing hordes of goblins, kobolds, skeletons, and demons and those that command them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6iViZt6Cjbp9AiMcTj2gfg__original/img/gjxmV5P7X2z-jdRurv7MEzBYIvU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8078468.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6iViZt6Cjbp9AiMcTj2gfg__thumb/img/tzUWcExDEAUXq18drsK0agynz-Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8078468.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.68,"rank":-1,"designers":["Matt Bender","Christopher Burton","Matthew Kroll","Richard Launius","Darrell Louder"],"publishers":["Greater Than Games, LLC"],"artists":["Jacob Croft","Nolan Nasser"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
