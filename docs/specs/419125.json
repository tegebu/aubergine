{"gameId":419125,"name":"Sparks","description":"This robot factory needs you! With the assistance of your trusty animal companions, mechanical marvels will soon start rolling off your assembly line &mdash; then you just need to add some spark to bring those robots alive. Explore the junkyard to gather dice for constructing robots or upgrading your factory. Keep a keen eye on your line-up of charming animal aides; they're the cornerstone of your winning strategy.&#10;&#10;In Sparks, each player runs a robot factory and takes turns being the active player. As the active player, you play one of your production tiles to take a number of dice from the junkyard; all other players then take one die each. All players simultaneously use their dice to complete robots or level up their factory.&#10;&#10;Players can also use spark to activate the abilities of their completed robots, or use cogs to recruit their animal assistants. You start the game with six assistants, each with a unique ability, and you should shape your strategy around them. The variety of assistants ensures that each game provides a different challenge. In the advanced game, players draft the assistants, providing more strategic options.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xFZSvX7_gq0aFr74UarkaA__original/img/L4AOISa6MXOgmrDqTmdK5S7CQQA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8142784.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xFZSvX7_gq0aFr74UarkaA__thumb/img/69fhxpDmvtsVOhNBzppyCgou-RM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8142784.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Open Drafting","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.52293,"averageRating":7.67742,"rank":16728,"designers":["Adrian Adamescu","Kristian Amundsen Østby","Florin Purluca","Kjetil Svendsen"],"publishers":["Alion – by Dr Ø"],"artists":["Reese Keefe"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
