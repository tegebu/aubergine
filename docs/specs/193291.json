{"gameId":193291,"name":"Orient Express","description":"Europe is a continent that is both insular by nation, yet hopelessly entangled economically as a whole. You have decided to be a part of the growing railroad boom. All over the continent, rails are needed to connect disparate regions for business and recreation. As your lines cover more ground, it is likely that they be coveted by the very governments you have chosen to support. Eventually they will nationalize your work. Of course you will be well rewarded, but your company will have to start all over in new locations to keep moving ahead. Victory will come to those most able to merge the private and public demands. You may be the mogul that creates the Orient Express, but eventually all of your hard work will become property of the people.&#10;&#10;Orient Express is the sequel to 20th Century Limited. Players create passenger routes or some of the most famous railroads of Europe. When Regional Company routes are scored, they are removed from the board as those routes have been nationalized. The game is very flexible, allowing players to choose which regions to build in and which ones to connect.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/wqmvbkiIuHHZ2R8zBkna90sWOzo=/0x0/pic3618429.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/xlT1H6JQdM8j5_RrRCvMId1Of_o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3618429.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Network and Route Building"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2017,"bggRating":5.58147,"averageRating":7.01955,"rank":7673,"designers":["Carla Horger","Jeff Horger"],"publishers":["Rio Grande Games"],"artists":["James Davis (II)"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
