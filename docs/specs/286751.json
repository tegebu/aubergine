In Zombicide, zombies are controlled by the game, while players take on the role of survivors who must co-operate in order to survive and thrive in a world overrun by the bloodthirsty undead. Find guns and gear to take the fight to the zombies through 25 different scenarios linked by a branching story as you pick your way through an infested city.&#10;&#10;Zombicide (2nd Edition) features refined and streamlined rules, including updates to target priority for ranged attacks, interactions with doors, and vehicle mechanisms.  A new dark zone feature, a zone that hides zombies from survivor's attacks, has been added as well. Zombicide (2nd Edition) will include new components and miniatures as well, including plastic dashboards and new child survivors. Returning players will be able to use their existing collection from previous Zombicide releases as well.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/81AiTz4hp4TlnzeCMqQMAw__original/img/YJv_Ah9d-me5hoy9s49g3eW1h3c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6091316.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/81AiTz4hp4TlnzeCMqQMAw__thumb/img/4i2gR6ZpAY3pCBJ-n4681BGhrUU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6091316.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Multiple Maps","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Team-Based Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.91877,"averageRating":8.13229,"rank":2863,"designers":["Raphaël Guiton","Jean-Baptiste Lullien","Nicolas Raoult"],"publishers":["CMON Global Limited","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Asmodee Italia","Guillotine Games","Hobby World","Portal Games","YOKA Games"],"artists":["Édouard Guiton","Thierry Masson","Eric Nouhaut"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":9,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":4,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
