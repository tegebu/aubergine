{"gameId":316624,"name":"Stationfall","description":"What is Stationfall?  Well, imagine a dozen or so random humans, robots, and none-of-the-aboves, each with their own abilities, goals, and secret relationships, have been turned loose on a space station that is going to be incinerated in approximately 15 minutes.  You are one of these weirdos, and you have collaborators on hand ready to assist you in achieving your goals.  There's also definitely probably some sort of alien presence or murderous monster locked up on board, maybe.  Stationfall is unbalanced, inasmuch as certain characters have overlapping goals with others, not to mention overlapping conspirators.  Opposing identities are unknown at the start of the game.  Their actions may be unpredictable, violent, or disrupt your plans.  Or most likely all of the above.&#10;&#10;Due to the actions of your opponents, seemingly simple victory conditions may only be achievable through complex means.  Stationfall is a box full of creative solutions, but that box is going to morph, twist, and grow teeth over the course of play.  Your best turns will exploit the unique tactical freedom of being a secret conspiracy, as well as deductions about your opponents&rsquo; identities and motives.  Stationfall is messy, intricate, and full of dangerous variables.  Welcome to the Station.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eUiju5SqZbkNt8gnEofrTw__original/img/Pq-vuK7-kGMs_pcZdFIeldHNLlU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6035127.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eUiju5SqZbkNt8gnEofrTw__thumb/img/zNkmLNyeXJGOY24FeAAf4U67ejU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6035127.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":9,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Deduction","Hidden Roles","Hidden Victory Points","Pick-up and Deliver","Roles with Asymmetric Information"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.64706,"rank":-1,"designers":["Matt Eklund"],"publishers":["Ion Game Design"],"artists":["Anne Isaksson","Josefin Strand","Madeleine Fj√§ll"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":8,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":9,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":9,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
