{"gameId":361552,"name":"Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn","description":"Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn is a cooperative game of adventure and strategy where you play heroes battling against the terrifying Dragon Army. As conflict rages around you, maneuver between battlefields and adventure locations to tip the scales of war.&#10;&#10;This stand-alone board game includes rules for integrating characters from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons companion adventure Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen (sold separately or available together in the Deluxe Edition bundle.)&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We zero in on this notion that Dragonlance is a war story,&rdquo; said Ray Winninger, head of D&amp;D at Wizards. &ldquo;Classic Dragonlance is set against the backdrop of this massive conflict, and these sort of massive military battles are an important part of Dragonlance. One of the original 12 Dragonlance modules was a wargame Dragons of Glory. They asked you to stop your role-playing game experience and start playing a wargame for a bit.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;[It] allows you to play out sort of massive military battles in the world of Krynn. But one of the interesting things about that game is that it has a lot of narrative elements, just like a role-playing game.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&#10;        - Ray Winninger &#10;&#10;&#10;See also Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen Deluxe Edition (bundle) and Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen (RPG).&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8gHeDPOBZRxiGU1SbSaiow__original/img/SZ9pipYKgnu3bOGdvSWjKMlNaDk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7018584.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8gHeDPOBZRxiGU1SbSaiow__thumb/img/em9qBw52L7QDIwrrzjntDiCSaHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7018584.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.53952,"averageRating":6.94677,"rank":12898,"designers":["Stephen Baker","Rob Daviau"],"publishers":["Wizards of the Coast"],"artists":["Tom Babbey","David René Christensen","Nikki Dawes","Olga Drebas","Tinnel Lovitt","Warren Mahy","Antonio José Manzanedo","Dominic Mayer","Calder Moore","Claudio Pozas","Julio Reyna","Hex Sharpe","David Sladek","Shawn Wood"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
