{"gameId":148729,"name":"Maquis","description":"Engage the Nazi occupation of France in la petite guerre to throw off the yoke of the oppressors and free your homeland!&#10;&#10;Maquis is a solitaire worker-placement game with variable goals and a play time of approximately twenty minutes. The player places his resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve his goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wgHvFfiPzMJUFrP4OLKtwQ__original/img/PP2_ccIAK3t_y1CU_6Wz4kCR_3c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5009864.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wgHvFfiPzMJUFrP4OLKtwQ__thumb/img/OAmwv-znUfaQFLPjiS1BpBjDUtM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5009864.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2013,"bggRating":6.30799,"averageRating":7.38668,"rank":1401,"designers":["Jake Staines"],"publishers":["(Web published)","GateOnGames","Side Room Games","Treetato Studio"],"artists":["Ilya Baranovsky","Jake Staines"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":28,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
