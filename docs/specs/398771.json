{"gameId":398771,"name":"Die Patin","description":"The streets of Beasty Town are a tough place. The city's major underground families are in dispute, with each trying to expand its territory and fill its coffers with loot &mdash; but vassals don't come cheap, and loyal vassals even less so...&#10;&#10;In Die Patin (&quot;The Godmother&quot;), players slip into the role of mafia bosses on the hunt for prestige and influence. With the help of their henchmen and a chunk of bribe money, they bring one city district after another under their control. However, conquering new territories is just as easy as losing them again, and those who position their guards poorly are a sitting duck for their opponents.&#10;&#10;The player who plans their raids best and goes on the offensive at the right moment will become Beasty Town's new overlady.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fxqH20PvBpdrZYGUs7YemQ__original/img/WiS5TVHyul5EKjnnHznz31SDKwY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7681014.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fxqH20PvBpdrZYGUs7YemQ__thumb/img/CdAVWWMOvfey9PVYiqRMy5zBoKw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7681014.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.52954,"averageRating":7.38784,"rank":14670,"designers":["Pim Thunborg"],"publishers":["Zoch Verlag"],"artists":["Alexander Jung"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
