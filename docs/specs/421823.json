{"gameId":421823,"name":"Ã†terna","description":"In &AElig;terna, you take the role of a Roman Gens (family) that will try to increase its prestige through three eras: the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic, and the Roman Empire.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to increase your influence over the city by supporting the conquest of the provinces, ruling over &quot;the seven hills of Rome&quot;, and contributing to the construction of monuments and buildings. While doing this, you must not demotivate the people in the hills under your direct control as unrest could put you in a bad light. If you manage majorities, cards, and resources better than your opponents, your Gens will be remembered in the history books as one of the most important in Rome.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2nK2uzqBfba_A3zwXLBXhw__original/img/tBlB4QDjE1xZa59_aW9KDHNUHJI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8224690.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2nK2uzqBfba_A3zwXLBXhw__thumb/img/MOTSyBKc5y4WTPJ-Z_KDtl0azS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8224690.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.59331,"averageRating":7.67078,"rank":9157,"designers":["Martin Wallace"],"publishers":["Ergo Ludo Editions","Ares Games","Grail Games","Hobby Japan","MS Edizioni","Schwerkraft-Verlag","Zvezda"],"artists":["Emiliano Mammucari","Andreas Rocha"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":4,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
