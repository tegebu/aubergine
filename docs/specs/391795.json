{"gameId":391795,"name":"Kinfire Delve: Vainglory's Grotto","description":"Kinfire Delve: Vainglory's Grotto is a tactical and cooperative card game for 1-2 players.  As Seekers, you will fight your way through the well deck of challenge cards to reach Vainglory, the master of the well, and face her in an epic final battle.&#10;&#10;To defeat Vainglory, you'll battle and puzzle your way through her well deck of 57 challenge cards before facing her final gauntlet. On your turn, attempt a challenge by playing a matching skill card and rolling the dice. Add enough progress tokens to a challenge and you'll be richly rewarded. But fail and you'll face the penalty by losing health, discarding cards, or being forced to return cards to the well deck.&#10;&#10;Even when it's not your turn, the cards in your hand can be played to boost your teammate's action. But be cautious&ndash;emptying your hand means gaining exhaustion and suffering effects that can lose you the game.&#10;&#10;Survive long enough to reach the bottom of the well and reveal Vainglory's final form. Break through her gauntlet of protectors in order to face and defeat her once and for all and win the game.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/io5dPH2ImA5uqoLsO7K1GA__original/img/YSHX304i8sCqhyvW6wk9Xy8Y1go=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7570975.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/io5dPH2ImA5uqoLsO7K1GA__thumb/img/P613Xg4KWA4NO5KE4-ZOBqboTys=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7570975.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Multi-Use Cards"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.40625,"rank":-1,"designers":["Kevin Wilson"],"publishers":["Incredible Dream Studios"],"artists":["Katarzyna Bekus","Sandra Chlewi≈Ñska","Weronika Kozyra","Katarzyna Redesiuk"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
