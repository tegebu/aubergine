{"gameId":300217,"name":"Merchants of the Dark Road","description":"After half a year of daylight, we must now prepare for the dark season. The roads will be treacherous but they will still need to be braved by a select few in order to keep our cities thriving. In Merchants of the Dark Road, you are one of these brave few merchants that travel the dangerous paths between cities. While the job is perilous, fame and fortune await.&#10;&#10;Discover the capital city where most of your actions will take place using a rondel action system. Collect and produce items to add to your caravan, or sell these items to local heroes and hire them to travel with you. Manipulate the market price of items, visit the back alley sellers, or delve a nearby dungeon for magical items to gain the potential for even more coin and notoriety.&#10;&#10;Gather lanterns to ease your passage along the dark roads as you guide your caravan to distant villages. Deliver goods and heroes to the best destinations and gain fame for your bravery! Balance the money you earn with the height of your fame because your final score after a number of game rounds will reflect the lowest of these two values.&#10;&#10;After all, what good is a purse full of the coin if the people don&rsquo;t sing songs about you, and what good is a song with an empty mug of ale?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m0097WIpBdC7tdA-mVi5Fw__original/img/bd3RYiimI4iWs2w1u27_2w4ImOI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5252479.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m0097WIpBdC7tdA-mVi5Fw__thumb/img/vGQx16-veWt64dxdrQA8w2VlsHA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5252479.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Contracts","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Follow","Hidden Victory Points","Highest-Lowest Scoring","Market","Pick-up and Deliver","Rondel","Set Collection","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.21773,"averageRating":7.61151,"rank":1743,"designers":["Brian Suhre"],"publishers":["Elf Creek Games","Happy meeple games","Lucrum Games","Skellig Games"],"artists":["Andrew Bosley","Joey Julian","Matt Paquette & Co."],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":8,"recommended":13,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":8,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":20,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":16,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
