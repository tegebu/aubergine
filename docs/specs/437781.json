{"gameId":437781,"name":"Digit Code","description":"For some unknown reason, we now find ourselves in a situation where we must quickly interpret a six-digit digital code. We will analyze this code by gathering various uncertain pieces of information. Its meaning will become clear in our hands, just as it always has.&#10;&#10;In Digit Code, each player in a two-player game creates a secret six-digit code, with three numbers above three numbers, with a digit 0-9 appearing at most twice and not adjacent to one another. The letters A-Y are used to indicate number segments in a column or in a row, or within a particular digit. Players take turns asking each other questions of the following four types:&#10;&#10;&#10;     How many spaces in row ? or column ? are filled?&#10;     Is the number ? even or odd?&#10;     Looking at the adjacent numbers ? and ??, which one is larger?&#10;     Is the segment at row ? and column ?? filled?&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player must ask all four question types before they can repeat a question type. On a turn, a player can give a six-digit number instead of a question. If they have guessed all six numbers correctly, they win; if not, the opponent says &quot;Wrong&quot;, and the game continues. If a player guesses incorrectly twice, they lose.&#10;&#10;With three or more players, one player creates a six-digit number that the other players race to deduce first, with the players asking questions in turn. Once again, if a player guesses incorrectly twice, they are out of the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bb7tVh1li4_3sNNhlKJ1xw__original/img/2iPud3zi_vpUp_ufR_NTX3TIzto=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8688119.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bb7tVh1li4_3sNNhlKJ1xw__thumb/img/KZUKK-9fG6VGBXgImM8It0g5O-Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8688119.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":25,"mechanics":["Deduction"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.55794,"averageRating":6.44867,"rank":11829,"designers":["Shota Hasuike"],"publishers":["Playte"],"artists":["Wanjin Gill"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":8,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
