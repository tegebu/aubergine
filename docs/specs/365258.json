{"gameId":365258,"name":"World Wonders","description":"Take on the role of the great leaders of the past to build your own Ancient City.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns spending their gold each round to build tiles that will increase their city's economy. A city that produces more food and generates commerce brings more population. Make your city grow!&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of buildings, each of which provides resources that will help your city evolve from a simple settlement to the largest city in the world.&#10;&#10;To place new buildings in your city you will also need a lot of roads. Don&rsquo;t forget about monuments, which are just as important as the buildings. These will bring you victory points, but claiming one will consume the rest of your gold for the round.&#10;&#10;Choose your timing and placement wisely! If your gold runs out, your round is over. Once all players have spent their gold, a new round begins and new buildings and roads will become available.&#10;&#10;After 10 rounds or as soon as a player reaches the maximum population limit, the leader of the best city in the ancient world will be the winner of World Wonders!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GGi5aUL1dVQIrytxgXow4g__original/img/ZpVBZXZhs1plAi5s4M7Db3YwBLc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7604558.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GGi5aUL1dVQIrytxgXow4g__thumb/img/90wLgUROk-IetKyXz2Fa7zNBCVs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7604558.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":70,"mechanics":["Action Points","Grid Coverage","Loans","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Square Grid","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.84351,"averageRating":7.66158,"rank":656,"designers":["Zé Mendes"],"publishers":["MeepleBR","MUNDUS","Arcane Wonders","CMON Global Limited","GateOnGames","Gém Klub Kft.","Glyptodon","Hobby Japan","Jianjie Star Games","Kobold Spieleverlag","Lavka Games","Lucky Duck Games","Maldito Games","Super Meeple","TLAMA games"],"artists":["Odysseas Stamoglou","Tom Ventre"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":31,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":17,"recommended":46,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":51,"recommended":17,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":18,"recommended":44,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":4,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":32,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":27,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
