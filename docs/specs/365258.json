{"gameId":365258,"name":"World Wonders","description":"Take on the role of the great leaders of the past to build your own Ancient City.&#10;&#10;Each player will use their Gold each round to build tiles that will increase their city's economy. A city that produces more food and generates commerce brings more population. Make your city grow! There are 5 types of buildings, and each of them provides a type of resource that will make your city evolve from a simple settlement to the largest city in the world. To place new buildings in your city, you will also need a lot of roads. As important as the buildings are monuments and wonders tokens. These will bring you a lot of victory points, but will consume all your Gold. Be wise in choosing when and where to place them. If your Gold runs out, your turn is over. Once all players have spent their Gold, a new round begins and new buildings and roads will be available to everyone.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player reaches the maximum population limit, the leader of the best city in the ancient world will be the winner of World Wonders!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GGi5aUL1dVQIrytxgXow4g__original/img/ZpVBZXZhs1plAi5s4M7Db3YwBLc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7604558.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GGi5aUL1dVQIrytxgXow4g__thumb/img/90wLgUROk-IetKyXz2Fa7zNBCVs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7604558.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":70,"mechanics":["Action Points","Grid Coverage","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.51536,"averageRating":7.76995,"rank":1168,"designers":["Zé Mendes"],"publishers":["MeepleBR","MUNDUS","Arcane Wonders","CMON Global Limited","Gém Klub Kft.","Glyptodon","Hobby Japan","Kobold Spieleverlag","Lucky Duck Games","Maldito Games","Super Meeple","TLAMA games"],"artists":["Odysseas Stamoglou","Tom Ventre"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":16,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":13,"recommended":16,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":22,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":6,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
