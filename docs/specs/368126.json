{"gameId":368126,"name":"Arabella","description":"Arabella is a 18XX roll-and-write for 1-4 players, set in Estonia. The goal is to collect most victory points but similar to other 18XX games trains, shares and dividends play here an important part.&#10;&#10;During their turn players choose dice from the common dice pool - the amount of dice chosen and also the value of these dice are important - to perform one action. As an action you can buy shares and trains, build tracks and also run trains for income and dividends. Game ends when one of the players has either reached the end of one of their income tracks or the last 6-train is bought. After that victory points are collected - most of them from fulfilled objective cards but also from shares and unlocked dice/modifiers.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ggFwkSzs88Uacd10Zk3MA__original/img/2nK6CK8zfchFsbuVfEZyIcv6AYk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6991925.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8ggFwkSzs88Uacd10Zk3MA__thumb/img/izg7T8O0tipEGaCRBYkdeElv4bk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6991925.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Network and Route Building","Paper-and-Pencil","Stock Holding"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.57143,"rank":-1,"designers":["Signe Aasoja"],"publishers":["2D6.EE (Side Quest Games)"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
