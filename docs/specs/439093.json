{"gameId":439093,"name":"Red Dog Junction","description":"Red Dog Junction is a fast-paced board game of high-stakes trading, crew-building, and strategic maneuvering in the far reaches of space. As the captain of a rogue freighter, players navigate the lawless frontier, mining valuable resources, salvaging lost cargo, and making high-risk trades at the notorious Red Dog Junction. Rival captains compete for fortune, and deception is always an option.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players take two actions, moving their ships between bases, planets, the fence at Honest Joe's Haberdashery, the Red Dog trading exchange, and deep space. They mine for ore, salvage wreckage, trade on the ever-shifting market, and recruit crew members to improve efficiency. Upgrading ship storage, hiring specialist officers, and executing powerful one-time boosts provide strategic advantages. The game ends when all the gold is stored in player bases, making timing and resource management critical.&#10;&#10;With a dynamic economy driven by player actions, Red Dog Junction offers a blend of worker placement, deck-building, pick-up-and-delivery, and market manipulation. The game plays about 15-20 minutes per player, creating a rich and highly interactive experience that rewards clever planning, risk-taking, and strategic maneuvering in a shifting economy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c3w6ceNLWyJmYfZt45OlXA__original/img/rsN5GXz9jdVP9Zcutv5Ty6Z-pHM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8699564.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c3w6ceNLWyJmYfZt45OlXA__thumb/img/lZR_iChJWpPrzLeiT6NCAMzLYVE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8699564.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Market","Pick-up and Deliver","Race","Victory Points as a Resource","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Tyler Cheves","Brendon Cheves"],"publishers":["Waterworks Games"],"artists":["Marie Bergeron"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
