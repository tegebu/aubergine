{"gameId":300936,"name":"Via Magica","description":"In Via Magica, a new version of Rise of Augustus, you vie with your fellow players to complete &quot;objective&quot; cards for special powers and ultimately for victory points. Each card has 2-6 symbols which you must populate with tokens in order to complete the card. These symbols are drawn one at a time from a bag, with all players gaining the benefit equally, but interestingly, the bag contains more of some symbols than others.&#10;&#10;So the pivotal skill you'll deploy is in making your choice of which three objectives you'll start the game with (you're dealt six) &mdash; balancing potential difficulty of completion against value of the reward &mdash; and then which of five available objectives you'll add to your plate each time you complete one of your three. The game ends when someone completes seven objectives.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a1oAJngPovEoTopMY6fJOg__original/img/PWWA7GSNgvUfepF_wncSbDBMEos=/0x0/pic5381155.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a1oAJngPovEoTopMY6fJOg__thumb/img/BCYZjCXEcwzr-MKHomDbDk-J_KM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5381155.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Bingo","Card Drafting","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.6673,"averageRating":7.18553,"rank":5236,"designers":["Paolo Mori"],"publishers":["Hurrican","Oliphante","Reflexshop"],"artists":["Biboun","Camille Chaussy","Jérémie Fleury","Mathieu Leyssenne","Paul Mafayon","Jean-Baptiste Reynaud","Régis Torres"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":2,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
