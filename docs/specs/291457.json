{"gameId":291457,"name":"Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion","description":"Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters &mdash; Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) &mdash; that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?&#10;&#10;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry &mdash; i.e., learning the game &mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_HhIdavYW-hid20Iq3hhmg__original/img/PBzsLRqNKQKJxGnzpb7o3qLWPQM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5055631.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_HhIdavYW-hid20Iq3hhmg__thumb/img/OMkN_E5eyWrkID_cHCnQEbIixGM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5055631.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Action Retrieval","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Critical Hits and Failures","Deck Construction","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Legacy Game","Line of Sight","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Simultaneous Action Selection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":8.2531,"averageRating":8.69378,"rank":6,"designers":["Isaac Childres"],"publishers":["Cephalofair Games","Albi","Albi Polska","Asmodee","Asmodee China","Asmodee Italia","Feuerland Spiele","Hobby World","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Siam Board Games"],"artists":["Francesca Baerald","David Demaret","Alexandr Elichev"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":58,"recommended":187,"notRecommended":45,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":163,"recommended":165,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":122,"recommended":160,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":87,"recommended":154,"notRecommended":42,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":209,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
