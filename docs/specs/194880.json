You are going to play a part of designers who will plan a house and add more and more rooms to it.&#10;&#10;Dream Home is a family game about building and furnishing your new house. Over twelve rounds, players collect pairs of cards consisting of a room card and an accessory card (roof, helper, furnishing or tool) and place them on their personal boards, creating their dream homes.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, all players&rsquo; houses are finished and fully furnished. Players compare their houses, counting points for functionality, good design, quality of roof and furnishing. The player with the nicest and most comfortable house wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CtVH__gM0TBISzOzV3OeFQ__original/img/d2B_-IP89EV5g22xMzggb4yyit0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3176771.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CtVH__gM0TBISzOzV3OeFQ__thumb/img/2aOcQ_RKw7fJYJTTdWrFHIk6coE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3176771.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Memory","Open Drafting","Pattern Building","Set Collection","Variable Phase Order"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2016,"bggRating":6.56326,"averageRating":6.89968,"rank":967,"designers":["Klemens Kalicki"],"publishers":["Rebel Sp. z o.o.","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Asmodee","Asmodee Italia","Asterion Press","Chronicle Games (Board Game)","Galápagos Jogos","Gém Klub Kft.","GoKids 玩樂小子","Hobby World","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Lex Games","MESAboardgames","Pegasus Spiele","Rebel Studio","White Goblin Games"],"artists":["Bartłomiej Kordowski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":37,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":13,"recommended":47,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":37,"recommended":28,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":48,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":30,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
