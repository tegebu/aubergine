{"gameId":191189,"name":"Aeon's End","description":"The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten underground city of Gravehold. There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.&#10;&#10;Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d50LceHj6LIafa4S_qIsCg__original/img/4MsKNGm47PU9BGW4i2yamMlRSQ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3189350.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d50LceHj6LIafa4S_qIsCg__thumb/img/KMFA-gXm_LbZpyXSAHbIZm-eAcQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3189350.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Cooperative Game","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Delayed Purchase","Hand Management","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Phase Order","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2016,"bggRating":7.63003,"averageRating":8.02005,"rank":69,"designers":["Kevin Riley"],"publishers":["Action Phase Games","Indie Boards & Cards","Angry Lion Games","Arclight","Frosted Games","Matagot","Pegasus Spiele","Portal Games","SD Games","Surfin' Meeple China"],"artists":["Gong Studios","Stephanie Gustafsson","Scott Hartman","Daniel Solis"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":58,"recommended":147,"notRecommended":27,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":218,"recommended":59,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":49,"recommended":145,"notRecommended":27,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":24,"recommended":143,"notRecommended":53,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":139,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
