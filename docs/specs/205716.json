It is here, in New Angeles, that you'll find the global headquarters for the worlds' most powerful megacorps: Haas-Bioroid, Globalsec, Jinteki, Melange Mining, NBN, and the Weyland Consortium. And it is here, in this shining beacon of human achievement and advancement, that these powerful megacorps enjoy a uniquely fertile breeding ground for their projects and their rivalries.&#10;&#10;In New Angeles, you gain control of one of these megacorporations, then you use your wealth and influence to create more wealth and more influence. To do this, you cut deals and forge temporary alliances. You leverage your credits and assets to gain financial superiority over your corporate rivals. All the while, you also need to keep an eye toward the masses, striking deals with the other corps as necessary in order to keep a lid on crime, disease, and unrest. If you want to maximize your profit, you need to keep New Angeles open for business!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HqgIDXSo5OkQNg20OIJmaA__original/img/umZ8J1ct7Md-RSBylNWewOti4wk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3123155.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HqgIDXSo5OkQNg20OIJmaA__thumb/img/8AfKtRfVXXUlg9a-C-MiKa_CPa4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3123155.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":240,"mechanics":["Hidden Roles","Semi-Cooperative Game","Traitor Game","Variable Player Powers","Voting"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2016,"bggRating":6.45966,"averageRating":7.13182,"rank":1108,"designers":["James Kniffen"],"publishers":["Asmodee","Asterion Press","Edge Entertainment","Fantasy Flight Games","Galakta","Game Harbor","Heidelberger Spieleverlag","Hobby World"],"artists":["Henning Ludvigsen"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":42,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":43,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":44,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":32,"notRecommended":18,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":20,"recommended":36,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":39,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":30,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
