{"gameId":396714,"name":"Monty Python and the Holy Grail: The Game","description":"Play as King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, and the rest of the brave Knights on their Quest for the Holy Grail! Players travel a twisty maze of paths to visit the many absurd and memorable locations they saw in that one movie, all while avoiding the Black Knight who stalks the Players across the board. Each location has its own unique purpose that will bring the Players one step closer to earning the Valor points they need to find the Holy Grail first, but your fellow Knights won&rsquo;t make it easy when they band together to hurl insults and sabotage your Quest. And just when you think you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out, another Player catapults a cow at you and you&rsquo;re suddenly left reevaluating your life choices. Everyone&rsquo;s a &ldquo;frenemy&rdquo; in this official play-at-home adaptation of the cult classic movie the New York Times once called &ldquo;a marvelously particular kind of lunatic endeavor&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g8mhVSIRhaGRLAsM_ddDQw__original/img/xcoUz2Gu5C7d4fTAhCzYFSg5k40=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7960669.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g8mhVSIRhaGRLAsM_ddDQw__thumb/img/zQyjBWScGLchAC7u0dy4FI1CjLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7960669.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Card Play Conflict Resolution","Interrupts","Kill Steal","Point to Point Movement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":3.25,"rank":-1,"designers":["Samuel Bryant","Gwen Ruelle"],"publishers":["Dynamite Entertainment"],"artists":["Chris Schweizer"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
