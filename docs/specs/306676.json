{"gameId":306676,"name":"Tales From the Loop: The Board Game","description":"In the Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, you take the roles of local kids and play cooperatively to investigate whatever phenomena that threaten the islands (or perhaps just the local video store), and hopefully stop them. Each day starts at school, but as soon as the bell rings you can use whatever time you have before dinner and homework to go exploring! Player actions are integrated, meaning there&rsquo;s no downtime as you wait for others taking their turn. It also makes cooperating with your fellow players dynamic as you can react to things that happen in a turn and don&rsquo;t have to plan it all out from the start.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ysaCi9ozqmjw9QgCDjtZ9Q__original/img/1vxY9qgfLPSZveoY9YkRZ3WIodw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5350329.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ysaCi9ozqmjw9QgCDjtZ9Q__thumb/img/0S3cMKgczKKuAytCtDGCB_Tyb9M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5350329.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Narrative Choice / Paragraph","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.5908,"averageRating":7.53774,"rank":7874,"designers":["Rickard Antroia","Martin Takaichi"],"publishers":["Free League Publishing"],"artists":["Reine Rosenberg","Simon St√•lenhag"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
