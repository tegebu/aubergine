{"gameId":337316,"name":"Glory: 2nd Edition","description":"Travel an old map with your dry erase hero board. Make notes, track your attributes, gain cards- everything in the game is dry erase.&#10;&#10;Your playing area will expand as you collect coinage, information, goods, abilities, and fate cards. As you adventure back and forth from the castle to more dangerous spaces, you will earn glory, complete quests, slay monsters and improve. You'll be offered goods and ability choices, resources to face harder challenges. Be the first to earn 20 points of glory to win. But take care: the more glory you have, the harder it is to earn more.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mt2nGgFxQ5VJmOG89VFk9g__original/img/kjvyzAXV6EIQ1ynG2i8ca4Fvtnw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6139769.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mt2nGgFxQ5VJmOG89VFk9g__thumb/img/ibrtn7F4P2I4MydRYN-Xl9_GN5E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6139769.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Point to Point Movement","Roll / Spin and Move","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jeremy Hogg"],"publishers":["Hogg Publishing"],"artists":["Simon Seene"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
