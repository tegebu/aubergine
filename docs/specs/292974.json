{"gameId":292974,"name":"Tournament at Avalon","description":"Tournament at Avalon takes players to the land where Excalibur was forged, building on the innovative mechanisms of Tournament at Camelot with new characters, cards, and mechanisms, allowing players to focus on informal diplomacy or alliances alongside the standard combat of the original game. It's a deep, challenging experience all on its own, with extra depth and complexity for players who own both games!&#10;&#10;In the game, you play as a legendary character, battling opponents with weapon cards: arrows, swords, deception, sorcery, and even alchemy. The more you injure your opponents, the better you fare in the tournament. However, even the most injured characters can make a complete comeback with the grace of Godsend cards and the aid of their special companions. This trick-taking game ends when one opponent has been injured to the point of death. The player with the most health is then declared the tournament victor!&#10;&#10;In Tournament at Avalon, you also have cards representing the legendary enchantress Morgan Le Fay and a new set of location panels that grant additional advantages to a player when they are the host of a tournament round. If you have Tournament at Camelot, you can mix and match your favorite cards, playing with either ruleset or combining the two games to play an epic &quot;Chaos of Battle&quot; tournament with seven or eight players!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_JOHDrU9qetjYY52-fL9ag__original/img/5i8xOtl5zY5IkWFsP-6_TYtZwxo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5052906.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_JOHDrU9qetjYY52-fL9ag__thumb/img/gLvJ-Hx6baQLEsqy-Ak0lcsxp4c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5052906.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Take That","Trick-taking","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.87618,"averageRating":7.57555,"rank":3179,"designers":["Karen Boginski","Jody Boginski-Barbessi","Kenneth C.
