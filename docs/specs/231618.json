Builds can range from a standard stealthy rogue with daggers to a mage that wields a greatsword.  During the game, players use the companion app to reveal new rooms and encounters which adds to replayability.  Players must work together to slay monsters, complete encounters, and achieve the goal of their quest.  Each quest has a different goal, from escorting a priest to complete a ritual to killing a giant troll that has been terrorizing a nearby town.&#10;&#10;Designed for 1-2 players.  You can add more players with additional sets.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yRHMFIc0DHvC8BcSJyIAOw__original/img/SevW14JUAOA_xp8XSs3UPS9Lhes=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4912059.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yRHMFIc0DHvC8BcSJyIAOw__thumb/img/Saa3Kcz8JV8FGGVDbb4-RopFR8U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4912059.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Movement","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Role Playing","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":5.70099,"averageRating":7.0449,"rank":5143,"designers":["Majdi Badri","Zeke Walker"],"publishers":["Ariah Studios"],"artists":["Jordan Cuffie"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
