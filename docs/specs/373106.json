{"gameId":373106,"name":"Sky Team","description":"Sky Team is a co-operative game, exclusively for two players, in which you play a pilot and co-pilot at the controls of an airliner. Your goal is to work together as a team to land your airplane in different airports around the world.&#10;&#10;To land your plane, you need to silently assign your dice to the correct spaces in your cockpit to balance the axis of your plane, control its speed, deploy the flaps, extend the landing gear, contact the control tower to clear your path, and even have a little coffee to improve your concentration enough to change the value of your dice.&#10;&#10;If the aircraft tilts too much and stalls, overshoots the airport, or collides with another aircraft, you lose the game...and your pilot's license...and probably your life.&#10;&#10;From Montreal to Tokyo, each airport offers its own set of challenges. Watch out for the turbulence as this could end up being bumpy ride!&#10;&#10;AWARDS &amp; HONORS&#10;&#10;2024 - Deutscher Spiele Preis 2024 - 2nd place &#10;2024 - BG Stats - Most popular game&#10;2024 - Gra roku (Game of the year Poland) - 2 player category winner&#10;2024 - International Gamers Awards - 2 player category winner&#10;2023 - Swams des Jahres winner&#10;2024 - Dice Tower Awards - Best 2 player game&#10;2024 - Dice Tower Awards - Best cooperative game&#10;2024 - Dice Tower Awards - Most innovative game&#10;2024 - Spiel des Jahres Winner&#10;2024 - Best Light Game - BBQ Awards&#10;2024 - Best Cooperative Board Game - Origins Awards&#10;2024 - Best 2023 Insider Game - Les Lys (Qu&eacute;bec) &#10;2024 - Game of the Year - Spiel des Jahres 2024 (Germany)&#10;2024 - Best 2-Player &amp; Innovation Gameplay - Big Awards 2024&#10;2024 - Best 2-Player &amp; Cooperative Game - Golden Geek Awards 2023&#10;       Runner up for Best Innovative &amp; Thematic Game - Golden Geek Awards 2023&#10;2023 - Best Cooperative Game - Board Game Quest&#10;2023 - Best 2-Player Game - Board Game Arena Awards&#10;2023 - Best 2-Player Game - Squirrelly Awards&#10;2023 - Best Board Game - Dicebreaker Tabletop Awards&#10;2023 - Two Player Board Game Winner - Game Boy Geek    &#10;2023 - Best Co-Op Game - Gaming Trend    &#10;2023 - Seal of Excellence - Dice Tower&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uXMeQzNenHb3zK7Hoa6b2w__original/img/mWOQnkpyYBorh_Y1-0Y2o-ew17k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7398904.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uXMeQzNenHb3zK7Hoa6b2w__thumb/img/WyPClajMWU9lV5BdCXiZnqdZgmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7398904.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Worker Placement with Dice Workers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":7.71505,"averageRating":8.19799,"rank":59,"designers":["Luc Rémond"],"publishers":["Scorpion Masqué","999 Games","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Asmodee","Geekach Games","Hachette Boardgames USA","Kaissa Chess & Games","KOSMOS","Lautapelit.fi","Lavka Games","Lucky Duck Games","Reflexshop","Sugorokuya","Tabletop KZ","YOKA Games"],"artists":["Eric Hibbeler","Adrien Rives"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":36,"notRecommended":109,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":175,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":140,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
