{"gameId":329465,"name":"Red Rising","description":"Enter the futuristic universe of Red Rising, based on the book series by Pierce Brown featuring a dystopian society divided into fourteen castes. You represent a house attempting to rise to power as you piece together an assortment of followers (represented by your hand of cards). Will you break the chains of the Society or embrace the dominance of the Golds?&#10;&#10;Red Rising is a hand-management, combo-building game for 1-6 players (45-60 minute playing time). You start with a hand of 5 cards, and on your turn you will deploy 1 of those cards to a location on the board, activating that card&rsquo;s deploy benefit. You will then gain the top card from another location (face up) or the deck (face down), gaining that locations benefit and adding the card to your hand as you enhance your end-game point total. If at any point you&rsquo;re really happy with your hand, you can instead use your turn to reveal a card from the top of the deck and place it on a location to gain that location&rsquo;s benefit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6QEXXgRgz3urOrRVZ_1zA__original/img/Gp9hIVv-zRxlkrO5Pmg3aXb4P1M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5960554.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6QEXXgRgz3urOrRVZ_1zA__thumb/img/8zjF-E9xPNYLSsI6xQjRsZiI-XE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5960554.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.85214,"averageRating":7.69272,"rank":3264,"designers":["Alexander Schmidt (II)","Jamey Stegmaier"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games","Grok Games","Ludofy Creative","Matagot","PHALANX","sternenschimmermeer"],"artists":["Jacqui Davis","Miles Bensky","Justin Wong"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":6,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":7,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
