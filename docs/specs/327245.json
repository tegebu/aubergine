However, not just any architect can be entrusted with such a task. Only those of influence and charitable reputation shall receive this great honour. Will you accompany the Princess as she surveys the projects, or rally support from the elusive Profiteer?&#10;&#10;Works of Wonder introduces an extension to the main board to hold the new Contribution/Consequence Cards, and keep track of players' Influence.
