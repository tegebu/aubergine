{"gameId":280834,"name":"For Science!","description":"You were never supposed to be the ones standing between the Earth and viral annihilation. So many other groups were better connected, better funded, better equipped, and had much nicer glossy brochures. But here you are, an eccentric bunch of researchers, lab workers, bureaucrats, virologists, and more ready to put it all on the line&hellip;&#10;&#10;&hellip;FOR SCIENCE!!!&#10;&#10;For Science! is a real-time, dexterity and spatial co-op where you first design Cures using cards, then literally Build those Cures using wooden blocks. If a Cure is too hard for you to Build, you can always go back and re-design a new one - but the clock is constantly running, and you only have 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Every successful Cure earns you Master Cure tiles, representing your increasing knowledge of how all these diseases have been constructed. Fit them together to amp up your researchers' special abilities and win the game!&#10;&#10;--description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4IylOZvG3Vz6kmYMKgD8Tw__original/img/DlA4CtBz3iG69f4BUNJIM1zyDMI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5315617.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4IylOZvG3Vz6kmYMKgD8Tw__thumb/img/KLdTRgx4gcKxepij2ZVjOCObOBI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5315617.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":15,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Hand Management","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.67249,"averageRating":7.28993,"rank":5519,"designers":["R.
