{"gameId":390478,"name":"Gloomhaven: Second Edition","description":"Gloomhaven: Second Edition is a revised and elevated version of the award-winning core game of Gloomhaven. This is the culmination of everything Isaac Childres and the growing Cephalofair Games team have learned since the initial release of Gloomhaven, including feedback from the community, playtesters, co-designers, and developers.&#10;&#10;The world, story, and challenging gameplay are all still the same, but there is a plethora of additional content to explore. Even for those who have played Gloomhaven before, this edition brings new material to the table, with rebalanced and redesigned mercenary classes, items, and scenarios, as well as brand new artwork, newly written narrative and events, updated miniatures, a new faction-based reputation system, and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y9jK4VRPjTLO2S6T-xz8sw__original/img/9X0MLfcigiyFq5IOoEWkaWxdtmc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7546274.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y9jK4VRPjTLO2S6T-xz8sw__thumb/img/ja9Ul9XKx8lR35ACm1rpHq-fpug=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7546274.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Action Retrieval","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Critical Hits and Failures","Deck Construction","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Legacy Game","Modular Board","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Role Playing","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Simultaneous Action Selection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tags","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.50895,"averageRating":6.03425,"rank":18468,"designers":["Isaac Childres","Drew Penn","Dennis VÃ¶gele"],"publishers":["Cephalofair Games"],"artists":["Paola Andreatta","Francesca Baerald","Sarah Dahlinger","Phan Tuan Dat","Mates Laurentiu","Chris Lewis"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
