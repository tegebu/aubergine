{"gameId":426268,"name":"Barrage: The Legendary Box","description":"The Kickstarter exclusive storage solution for ALL contents related to Barrage. It also expands the gameplay variety as it contains 2 NEW Companies!&#10;&#10;It includes the Far Companies Expansion: this expansion includes rules for two new companies to be used in addition to the four base ones and the fifth one already included in The Leeghwater Project expansion. These two companies have unique characteristics that significantly distinguish them from the standard companies both in terms of game mechanics and components.&#10;&#10;- The Japanese company uses Bases and Elevations inspired by the &ldquo;Earth-fill dams&rdquo;: on one hand, it is possible to use the Elevations as if they were Bases, greatly increasing the number of Dams that can be built; on the other hand, these dams will be limited in height and thus in capacity. Finally, the machinery used for the Elevations are Excavators instead of Concrete Mixers.&#10;&#10;- The Brazilian company specializes in versatility: Bases, Elevations, and Conduits can be built in any order from its board, with a greater choice of strength and type of bonuses; however, the elements related to stronger bonuses will result in the permanent loss of one machinery or more.&#10;&#10;Both companies unlock a special company ability when the third powerhouse is built.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0sywQlZzSxovpo-QxfrDJA__original/img/DDPGZCVjjAVsVw2fd0sluNxact0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8351100.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0sywQlZzSxovpo-QxfrDJA__thumb/img/nlXmhNCw1zshAXCfIMlkZrsvlvM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8351100.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Network and Route Building","Ownership","Turn Order: Stat-Based","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.53883,"rank":-1,"designers":["Tommaso Battista","Simone Luciani"],"publishers":["Cranio Creations"],"artists":["Alex Galbero"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
