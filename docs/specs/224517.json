{"gameId":224517,"name":"Brass: Birmingham","description":"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&#10;&#10;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&#10;&#10;New &quot;Sell&quot; system&#10;&#10;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&#10;&#10;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&#10;&#10;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&#10;&#10;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&#10;&#10;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Income","Loans","Market","Network and Route Building","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Turn Order: Stat-Based","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":8.43247,"averageRating":8.65476,"rank":2,"designers":["Gavan Brown","Matt Tolman","Martin Wallace"],"publishers":["Roxley","Arclight Games","BoardM Factory","Conclave Editora","CrowD Games","Dexker Games","Funforge","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","Ghenos Games","Giant Roc","Lord of Boards","Maldito Games","PHALANX","TLAMA games"],"artists":["Lina Cossette","David Forest","Damien Mammoliti"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":35,"notRecommended":395,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":74,"recommended":497,"notRecommended":82,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":416,"recommended":245,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":373,"recommended":241,"notRecommended":28,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":331,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
