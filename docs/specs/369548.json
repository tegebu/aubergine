{"gameId":369548,"name":"After Us","description":"2083. Humankind died out decades ago, leaving behind mere vestiges of its time on Earth. As time went by, nature reclaimed land all over. In this resurgent world, apes have kept evolving. They've been gathering in tribes, growing, mastering human items, and advancing in their quest for knowledge. As the leader of such a tribe, you need to guide it towards collective intelligence.&#10;&#10;After Us is a deck-building and resource management game featuring an original and intuitive combo system in which players are each leading a tribe of apes. Starting only with tamarins, they combine their cards each turn to collect resources and gather victory points, attracting new apes into their tribe along the way: powerful gorillas, resourceful orangutans, versatile chimpanzees, and wise mandrills. The first player to obtain 80 points prevails in the race to collective intelligence &mdash; and wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0p98Q5dENk3sh9mqd3xM0w__original/img/Om4e6Ew9yE-jttGA9OIQOiO7kVM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7471323.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0p98Q5dENk3sh9mqd3xM0w__thumb/img/o1EGwssgObCxAUjaBB_yKS4SXVs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7471323.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Race","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.76512,"averageRating":6.88781,"rank":4552,"designers":["Florian Sirieix"],"publishers":["Catch Up Games","Hachette Board Games UK","Lucrum Games","Maldito Games","MS Edizioni","Pandasaurus Games","Pegasus Spiele"],"artists":["Vincent Dutrait"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":4,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
