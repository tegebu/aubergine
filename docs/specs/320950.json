{"gameId":320950,"name":"Rift Knights","description":"In a clifftop monastery, an ancient order of holy knights watches over a sealed portal to the underworld. The knights must protect the elders&mdash;ancient sages who sustain the seal. Every year during the long night of the winter solstice, when the power of darkness is at its greatest, the seal weakens enough for a few demons to break through. Once inside, the monsters seek to battle past the valiant knights and slay enough of the elders to fully break the seal. Imbued with the power of the gods, only these sacred knights stand a chance at stopping an army of monsters from flooding into the world.&#10;&#10;Rift Knights is an asymmetrical team game for 2 to 6 players.&nbsp;One team controls the holy knights, who must protect the elders and withstand the demons until dawn.&nbsp;The other team controls the demons, who seek to break the seal to the underworld before morning. &nbsp;&#10;&#10;During the game, you choose a unique knight or demon, each with a variety of special powers, such as the Flame Knight&rsquo;s ability to surround his foes in fire, or the Bone Crusher&rsquo;s power to summon skeletal minions. You also play cards from your hand to perform actions each turn, and each card can be used in three different ways. Careful planning with these cards is rewarded with memorable, game-changing moments. A set of unique location tiles allows you to create the monastery with a different layout every game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/if1TuD3kySENW1WPNNxaZA__original/img/n6Gbx0L0u0GuaxZw35MxF_dOJS4=/0x0/pic5759612.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/if1TuD3kySENW1WPNNxaZA__thumb/img/JOoOe2i72CVd0TBAO2jj9_48ock=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5759612.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":4,"rank":-1,"designers":["T.
