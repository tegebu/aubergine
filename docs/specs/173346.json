{"gameId":173346,"name":"7 Wonders Duel","description":"In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&#10;&#10;What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WzNs1mA_o22ZWTR8fkLP2g__original/img/q_TrwF4VnXgW1dFQgtMJexSXOEA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3376065.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WzNs1mA_o22ZWTR8fkLP2g__thumb/img/qGf8-LJx4lsNOgpjS6iCs2TyKts=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3376065.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Layering","Set Collection","Sudden Death Ending","Tug of War"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2015,"bggRating":7.98447,"averageRating":8.10857,"rank":16,"designers":["Antoine Bauza","Bruno Cathala"],"publishers":["Repos Production","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Asmodee China","Asmodee Italia","Asterion Press","Galápagos Jogos","Gém Klub Kft.","KADABRA","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Lautapelit.fi","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd","Ludicus","Ponva d.o.o.","Pridemage Games","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Siam Board Games","Sombreros Production","Ігромаг"],"artists":["Miguel Coimbra"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":7,"recommended":50,"notRecommended":668,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":883,"recommended":21,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":696,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
