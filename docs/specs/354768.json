{"gameId":354768,"name":"The Dark Quarter","description":"Welcome to New Orleans, Louisiana, circa 1980: a vibrant city of music, food, and magic. Neon lights flicker in dirty puddles up and down Bourbon street; the innovations of the modern world clash with ancient and terrible traditions; and murder is never simple. The Beaumont Agency, staffed with a roster of brilliant, colorful, and ultimately &#239;&#172;&#130;awed private investigators, specializes in solving cases that no one else can crack.&#10;&#10;In The Dark Quarter, a co-operative app-driven adventure game set in a dark, fantastical vision of 1980s New Orleans, players each take control of a Beaumont agent and work alongside one another to solve the worst crimes that New Orleans has to offer. It's a world full of magic, where hexing curses are sold on every street, where voodoo priestesses and creatures of the night are lurking around every corner, and where even the most mundane crimes have a tinge of the supernatural to them.&#10;&#10;Through multi-scenario campaigns, the game tells a rich, dynamic story and invites players to make critical decisions that will not only affect their characters, but change the direction and course of the story. The characters are not simply avatars, easily replaceable from scenario to scenario; instead, they are woven into the very fabric of the story itself. Their destiny and the destiny of New Orleans are inextricably linked together.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NylXvHV5B2iOeYQQkzD8Dg__original/img/RhqkK6egwkWwL2OgWdRSf7QZq0M=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6625010.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NylXvHV5B2iOeYQQkzD8Dg__thumb/img/5nw2TWltGsY6o_TKdaM8AL9niOs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6625010.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Map Addition","Role Playing","Solo / Solitaire Game","Storytelling"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.61141,"averageRating":7.32261,"rank":8394,"designers":["Evan Derrick"],"publishers":["Lucky Duck Games","Van Ryder Games","Grimspire"],"artists":["Mateusz Komada","Jarek Noco≈Ñ"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
