{"gameId":325698,"name":"Juicy Fruits","description":"Each player has their own small island paradise where they grow delicious fruit. To win, you must gain the most points by cleverly supplying ships and by adding the best businesses to your island.&#10;&#10;Your turn in Juicy Fruits works like this: First, you slide one of your fruit collector tokens a number of unblocked spaces and collect that many fruits of the token's type: banana, orange, lime, pomegranate, or mangosteen. Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing). Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit &mdash; but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents. Also, the sooner businesses are claimed, the quicker the game might end.&#10;&#10;With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses. The game also includes an additional &quot;juice factory&quot; mode and four modes of solo play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZtCwwvnQF2--M2RFgqBvCA__original/img/ua5asb_Irh1Qy4oy2zywQh_lr8U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5989016.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZtCwwvnQF2--M2RFgqBvCA__thumb/img/oZsWskF46D6LLvMFasCvT31BEpI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5989016.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":50,"mechanics":["Area Movement","Contracts","Grid Movement","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.1461,"averageRating":7.17277,"rank":2015,"designers":["Christian St√∂hr"],"publishers":["Deep Print Games","999 Games","Capstone Games","Day Day Board Game","Gigamic","Maldito Games","Pegasus Spiele","PSC Games"],"artists":["Annika Heller"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":7,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":9,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
