While gods and mortals wage war on mighty giants and living dead, strange runes of fire materialize in the Nine Worlds.

The realms are crumbling, the end draws near, and only the mighty shall be remembered.&#10;&#10;The Bifrost Bridge has collapsed, trapping Odin and his armies in Asgard. The resulting war in Midgard will be a devastating clash with no assumed victor. Will Ases and Vanes save the Nine Worlds from destruction, or will chaos shatter these realms and reduce Yggdrasil to ashes?&#10;&#10;Mythic Battles is a 2 to 4 player legendary adventure, playable as a pure skirmish game, or as an epic saga comprised of numerous scenarios and campaigns.
