{"gameId":368386,"name":"El Burro: A La Granja Game","description":"In El Burro, you are developing a farm in Majorca and have to move your goods from your farm to the port of La Palma. The game uses multi-purpose cards and dice-drafting as in La Granja, while also containing other elements such as donkey cards, donkey deliveries, and a solo game. You need to manipulate your farm in the best way possible while making maximum use of your cards and the dice.&#10;&#10;In a game round, you play cards, draft dice (one at a time) to conduct actions, deliver goods to your own market stands or to local markets, and bring them all the way to the port of Palma.&#10;&#10;During the game, you score some points for deliveries, and at the end of four game rounds, you receive more points based on special cards and other elements. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lw7JsfCr0TvatjF6EeplWw__original/img/domd7bZCmdUNZTicTtbFMG6ztaM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7055560.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lw7JsfCr0TvatjF6EeplWw__thumb/img/mD3jsWVV8E88r81uZicY6qhhB4Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7055560.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Die Icon Resolution","Hand Management","Market","Multi-Use Cards","Pick-up and Deliver","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.66667,"rank":-1,"designers":["Michael Keller (II)","Andreas \"ode.\" Odendahl"],"publishers":["Spielworxx"],"artists":["Harald Lieske"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
