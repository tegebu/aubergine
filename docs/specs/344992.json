{"gameId":344992,"name":"Evolution: New World","description":"The diversity of living organisms inhabiting our planet is astonishing. According to the theory of evolution, random mutations occur all the time, granting new traits to animals and plants. These traits are then tested through natural selection. Animals with beneficial traits propagate more successfully than others, expand their habitat areas, and effectively protect themselves against predators and unfavorable conditions. Such species dominate the ecosystem, while poorly adapted animals become extinct.&#10;&#10;Evolution. New World is an updated and extended version of the basic Evolution. The Origin of Species game. It includes both well-known animal traits and new ones, complete with refined descriptions and colorful illustrations. Food is now generated using Area cards, and animals can use shelter to hide from predators.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2mJaG2uotmzW__PIMYPWXg__original/img/gqbmJ50ydRZIq6PaEBFNQqNZ6XQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6671299.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2mJaG2uotmzW__PIMYPWXg__thumb/img/S71Syk5qm3EkR_CSwXekTz29WKw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6671299.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.96552,"rank":-1,"designers":["Dmitry Knorre","Sergey Machin"],"publishers":["Rightgames RBG SIA","CrowD Games"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
