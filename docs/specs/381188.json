{"gameId":381188,"name":"Kauri","description":"Kauri is a strategic, asymmetric board game with high replayability that brings the historical settlement of New Zealand to life on a beautifully crafted game board with detailed wooden pieces. In this board game, four unique factions with distinct abilities, their own decks of cards, objectives, and gameplay mechanics battle for dominance: the M&#196;&#129;ori, the Englishman, the Possums, and the Kiwis.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the conflict stands the Kauri tree, the island&rsquo;s iconic symbol &mdash; but each faction follows a different strategy and scores points in its own way. The Kiwis must fight for their survival, while the Possums seek to expand their territory. The Englishman will first deforest the land before hunting the Possums, while the M&#196;&#129;ori build their sacred temples (Whare Nui).&#10;&#10;Over five intense rounds, players must strategically play their cards to take control of the island while preventing their opponents from gaining too many points. A game filled with strategy, historical authenticity, and dynamic challenges&mdash;will you claim victory?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ckp3lmvxIjsL9W9UkDW2kQ__original/img/nGLAnZtMG_Gw508ApiZ1dTJw2YU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7744197.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ckp3lmvxIjsL9W9UkDW2kQ__thumb/img/-JlhXiuqGv2q0YOyxbZ760ijDW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7744197.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.66596,"averageRating":7.4019,"rank":6714,"designers":["Charlec Couronnaud"],"publishers":["Débâcle Jeux","Koalla Spiele"],"artists":["Jérémie Fleury"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":10,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
