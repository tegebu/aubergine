You have just started your business in a rapidly expanding city.&#10;&#10;In Rolling Heights, players roll workers in the form of meeples. Standing meeples work hard that day and provide special actions and building materials, while face-down meeples provide nothing. You can always push your luck for better rolls, but you might lose valuable materials you need to construct new buildings. Completing buildings gains you prestige, as well as new workers to help you construct even larger buildings, including skyscrapers.&#10;&#10;Will you construct the next famous landmark?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ko4dCJkyNFD8u1W5SCDEZw__original/img/vOd9Cl56_-8I_Hw7AlqBS1mrpks=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5992107.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ko4dCJkyNFD8u1W5SCDEZw__thumb/img/ORIJ-VeEy_XufZ3Ym-kASJIrKDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5992107.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Push Your Luck","Random Production","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.66667,"rank":-1,"designers":["John D.
