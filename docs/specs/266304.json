At the end of the game, Awards are handed out that contribute to the final score, and points are lost if players have any pieces left over in their personal supplies. Whoever has the highest total is declared the winner, and the finest architect in your new MegaCity.&#10;&#10;Players build when it's not their turn, meaning this is a game with little downtime.
