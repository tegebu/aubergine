{"gameId":410201,"name":"Wyrmspan","description":"You are an amateur dracologist in the world of Wyrmspan, a place where dragons of all shapes, sizes, and colors roam the skies. Excavate a hidden labyrinth you recently unearthed on your land and entice these beautiful creatures to roost in the sanctuary of your caves.&#10;&#10;During a game of Wyrmspan, you will build a sanctuary for dragons of all shapes and sizes. Your sanctuary begins with 3 excavated spaces&mdash;the leftmost space in your Crimson Cavern, your Golden Grotto, and your Amethyst Abyss. Over the course of the game, you will excavate additional spaces in your sanctuary and entice dragons to live there, chaining together powerful abilities and earning the favor of the Dragon Guild.&#10;&#10;Wyrmspan is inspired by the mechanisms of Wingspan, though its unique elements make Wyrmspan a standalone game (not compatible with Wingspan).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oXUkkh9uq3zBVWQ8mbgMfQ__original/img/MW6S23AwpGGu0Rx05X_aByK0lmA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7947338.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oXUkkh9uq3zBVWQ8mbgMfQ__thumb/img/Ic3yRKTjVe26RgDzIdLsKn8Hztk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7947338.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game","Track Movement","Turn Order: Progressive"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":7.21559,"averageRating":8.09044,"rank":279,"designers":["Connie Vogelmann"],"publishers":["Stonemaier Games","999 Games","Delta Vision Publishing","Divercentro","Feuerland Spiele","Ghenos Games","Grok Games","Maldito Games","Matagot","MINDOK","NeoTroy Games","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Surfin' Meeple China","Ігромаг"],"artists":["Clémentine Campardou"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":62,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":43,"recommended":68,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":61,"recommended":40,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":18,"recommended":49,"notRecommended":30,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":73,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":65,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
