{"gameId":396015,"name":"Warhammer Underworlds: Two-Player Starter Set","description":"The Mirrored City of Shadespire is a nightmare plane of illusion and madness, an ever-changing labyrinth of endless stairs, cramped streets, and soaring archways. Dare you enter and claim the glory that awaits?&#10;&#10;This starter set is the ideal way to get into Warhammer Underworlds. With two complete warbands - the valiant Stormcast Eternals of Ironsoul&rsquo;s Condemnors and the undead Sepulchral Guard-, the full rules, and all of the dice, tokens, and boards that you need to play the game, there is no better choice to begin your adventures in the ultimate arena combat miniatures game.&#10;&#10;The warband-specific decks in this starter set are designed for use in the Rivals game format &ndash; a format that uses pre-made decks ready for play straight out of the box, so that while you may decide to craft your own card decks once comfortable with the rules, this is not a requirement to get started.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gECftEGm-zIFiFEmxkcKPw__original/img/nevgGWR5KgzoC8RNTcLr5-Pj8vc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7763848.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gECftEGm-zIFiFEmxkcKPw__thumb/img/6IB-h3Ggu65BLuWtrpkidKfY2MM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7763848.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.875,"rank":-1,"designers":[],"publishers":["Games Workshop Ltd."],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
