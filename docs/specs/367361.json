{"gameId":367361,"name":"Spaceship Unity","description":"Spaceship Unity takes gaming to a whole new level, transforming your home into a spaceship! As recruits of the IPA, i.e. the Interplanetary Alliance, the players experience an extraordinary story full of action and adventure and have to steer their own spaceship, with the fan turning into a jet engine, the blinds into a protective shield, the bookshelf into a diplomatic database, and much more!&#10;&#10;In Spaceship Unity &ndash; Season 1.1, the focus is on the story. As in a TV series, the story continues over several episodes (five in this case). Each of them is divided into multiple chapters with branching story paths for a different experience. As in real life, the story keeps going no matter how the crew performs. However, that doesn't mean the mission is to be taken lightly! After all, the players are the last hope for galactic peace, and the course of the story will change depending on the players' success or lack thereof, for better or for worse.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cVlFlWb7PRVa3I-rHVCS2w__original/img/0l1Us37oc_ojWjp4cvurP45lE6I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6972726.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cVlFlWb7PRVa3I-rHVCS2w__thumb/img/k0birqaxA69XskW2kxpxNGiI_-s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6972726.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Timer","Command Cards","Real-Time","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Simulation","Simultaneous Action Selection","Storytelling","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.65385,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ulrich Blum","Jens Merkl"],"publishers":["Pegasus Spiele"],"artists":["Eric Hibbeler"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
