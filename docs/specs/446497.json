{"gameId":446497,"name":"Hot Streak","description":"Hot Streak is a game for hard luck gamblers who love to bet on and scream at the racers, who in this case happen to be mascots who may (or may not) keep running in the right direction.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, set up the racing deck with one card for each mascot and a number of random cards based on the player count. Reveal these cards to all players, after which players draft a betting ticket from those on display, then in reverse order draft a second bet. For each bet, you can play it safe &mdash; or flip it to the risky side, which might pay out more...or cost you money if you lose. After betting, each player chooses one of three cards in their hand to secretly add to the racing deck.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the deck, burn three cards, then reveal cards one by one from the deck, moving the mascots along the track, with them sometimes swerving into another lane and knocking over another racer, sometimes turning around, sometimes all moving at once, and sometimes just going backwards! If a racer runs off the track or would be knocked over while already fallen, they're disqualified. If needed, shuffle all cards in the deck, burn three cards again, and keep racing until all four spots on the box podium are filled. Pay out bets based on these results.&#10;&#10;For races #2-3, first deal each player a random card from the deck, then place bets again, then have each player contribute a card from their hand to the deck. After race #3, everyone tallies their money.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Iv-Cg2gV0qNfLuJSKm_PpA__original/img/JXP3JJnV4RS5bVg6ytqPBNNge7I=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8883315.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Iv-Cg2gV0qNfLuJSKm_PpA__thumb/img/xpNtxTfCk11Tgga16n4O0q0kFHQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8883315.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":9,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Betting and Bluffing"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.45,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jon Perry"],"publishers":["CMYK"],"artists":["Cécile Gariépy"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":8,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":9,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":9,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
