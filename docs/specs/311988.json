{"gameId":311988,"name":"Frostpunk: The Board Game","description":"In Frostpunk: The Board Game, up to four players will take on the role of leaders of a small colony of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world that was hit by a severe ice age. Their duty is to effectively manage both its infrastructure and citizens. The core gameplay will be brutal, challenging, and complex, but easy to learn. The citizens won&rsquo;t just be speechless pieces on the board. Society members will issue demands and react accordingly to the current mood, so every decision and action bears consequences.&#10;&#10;The players will decide the fate of their people. Will you treat them like another resource? Are you going to be an inspiring builder, a fearless explorer, or a bright scientist? Is your rule going to be a sting of tyranny or an era of law and equality?&#10;&#10;The game is based on a bestseller video game by 11bit studios, the creators of This War Of Mine. The original (digital) edition of Frostpunk is a highly successful strategy-survival-city-builder, a BAFTA-nominee that originally launched in 2018.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/rKEX3KQ1_w3Vf5H5bDg7hjr74TM=/0x0/pic5508492.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bGmKjdpjCEQUuuXBFfR8TibdO1I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5508492.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Cooperative Game","Cube Tower","Modular Board","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Solo / Solitaire Game","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":5.54833,"averageRating":7.68525,"rank":9919,"designers":["Adam Kwapi≈Ñski"],"publishers":["Glass Cannon Unplugged","11 bit studios","Albi","ASYNCRON games","Frosted Games","Lotus Frog Games","Maldito Games","Pendragon Game Studio","Rebel Sp. z o.o."],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":6,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
