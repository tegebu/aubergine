{"gameId":377945,"name":"Endurance","description":"Endurance is a solitaire game of Antarctic survival, based on Ernest Shackleton's famous 1914 expedition. Stranded for eighteen months, the crew of the Endurance faced almost impossible challenges. Any one of these could have &ndash; by rights, should have &ndash; resulted in their deaths. Miraculously, every man survived.&#10;&#10;The game does regard this as a miracle &ndash; as the least likely result - and evokes it not through reproduction, but through its absence. This is a bleak and grueling game about suffering and perseverance. Faced with circumstances beyond your control, you must make the best choices you can. You'll be hunting for food, buoying the men's spirits with distractions, and managing your ever-dwindling supplies while dealing with a hostile and unpredictable environment.&#10;&#10;This game is unique in that there is no victory or loss condition. The game will end either when the men are rescued, or when rescue becomes impossible. How many men survived until then, and what that means, is up to you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zXDQFkntFFPHIWk_6tMzIg__original/img/xzVUv0Ive8cCfOU-d-ULbrNZ8Zk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7275470.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zXDQFkntFFPHIWk_6tMzIg__thumb/img/7pXl0uUTwDXawHa6LnBsn3h_DLU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7275470.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":1,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":10,"rank":-1,"designers":["Amabel Holland"],"publishers":["Hollandspiele"],"artists":["Amabel Holland"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
