{"gameId":317643,"name":"Kyoto","description":"Kyoto takes players straight into one of the burning issues of our time: climate change &mdash; and not with a wagging finger, but by putting them into the shoes of the decision makers.&#10;&#10;As delegates from different countries, players face a few quick rounds of negotiation at a climate conference. Together, they try to hit reduction targets and provide the needed funding, knowing that each round they fail to do so they inflict severe damage on the planet. But bent on preserving their own country's wealth and following their secret agendas, none of them may be eager to give more than absolutely necessary. After all, the winner will be whoever best preserves their wealth...unless the impending damage to earth becomes too severe, in which case the conference fails immediately and the greediest player can't win.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EV0aCdKNVGXSv6v5OMUoaQ__original/img/yLx-X3OEKBkSXC7Wqa_yflL5eA0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5617488.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EV0aCdKNVGXSv6v5OMUoaQ__thumb/img/vjKXdxvLxu8tdQCen9kmiVww8wY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5617488.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Bribery","Hand Management","Negotiation"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.53885,"averageRating":6.79412,"rank":11182,"designers":["Sabine Harrer","Johannes Krenner"],"publishers":["Deep Print Games","Pegasus Spiele"],"artists":["Christian Opperer"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
