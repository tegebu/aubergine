{"gameId":337324,"name":"ADELE","description":"A mission to Mars starts to go wrong when the on-board computer becomes self-aware and identifies the crew as potential threats...&#10;&#10;ADELE is a claustrophobic and stressful one-versus-many board game for up to 5 players.&#10;All but one player take on the role of crew members. Each one will choose a character board where a special ability, initial object and stats (spirit and life points) are indicated.&#10;The remaining player will control the powerful and vigilant AI of the spaceship: ADELE.&#10;&#10;On each turn, all crew members have 4 action cubes each, to secretly distribute them among the available actions, using a screen to hide their boards from ADELE.&#10;&#10;The ADELE player has to guess what actions each crew member plans and try to hinder them as best as possible. Managing a control panel (with its own deck of cards and pool of tokens) with a limited amount of energy per turn, ADELE will create incidents on the ship: originate fires, close floodgates, remove oxygen, shut down computers&hellip; there are many options!&#10;Will the crew be able to carry out a plan to survive?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZxxoD_yC3UWr-cLn9mCCw__original/img/nffCStUzMn9jAzabNC1gETleCB8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6148517.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZxxoD_yC3UWr-cLn9mCCw__thumb/img/mUovP7_BK-0E9JjUYlaea9I9Hd8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6148517.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Events","Hand Management","Pick-up and Deliver","Solo / Solitaire Game","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.875,"rank":-1,"designers":["Albert Reyes"],"publishers":["DMZ Games","Nice Game Publishing"],"artists":["Jos√© Soto"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
