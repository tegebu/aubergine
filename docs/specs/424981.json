{"gameId":424981,"name":"Eternal Decks","description":"Eternal Decks is a fully cooperative game where players are trying to complete the stage objectives before any one player cannot take an action. Players start the game with 5 cards in their deck, but will quickly look to acquire more cards from the various Eternals (characters within the game) who each have their own unique 8 card deck.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must perform one action:&#10;&#10;     Play a card (on the field, on the river, or use an ability)&#10;     Generate a jewel&#10;     Give a card to a teammate&#10;&#10;&#10;There are restrictions when playing a card. All 3 rows in the field cannot have cards of the same color or same number next to each other. Additional restrictions are applied to a row based on the stage you are playing. Jewels are used to negate the negative effects brought on by the Eternals.&#10;&#10;There are 6 stages currently in the game. The various stages will have you collect points, survive a ghost town, navigate a labyrinth, defeat a boss, and more to win the game!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bo6QYIQWzRRcn7KyO3AIPg__original/img/eQ-YojBJLh3FFFa_Cn-bbHbs-wk=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8512516.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bo6QYIQWzRRcn7KyO3AIPg__thumb/img/P9XzT5xp1nj-z8N379CrM7_ozNg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8512516.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Communication Limits","Cooperative Game","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Ordering","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.3875,"rank":-1,"designers":["Hiroken"],"publishers":["Tricktakers Games"],"artists":["MUJUNSHA"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
