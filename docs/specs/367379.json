{"gameId":367379,"name":"Deal with the Devil","description":"Deal with the Devil is a deeply thematic competitive Eurogame set in a fantasy medieval era. Each of the four players takes on a secret role of a mortal, a cultist, or even the Devil. Due to the asymmetrical roles, players experience the same game but with different game goals every play.&#10;&#10;During the blind trading phase, players can offer their resources in exchange for money from another player. The Devil will tempt mortals with goods for a piece of their soul, while the cultist's nature is to sell their soul easily. Only the accompanying app knows who is trading with whom.&#10;&#10;But beware! Showing off how well you are doing can attract unwelcome attention and the suspicion of other players. It also may pique the interest of the Inquisition, which is eager to punish those who cannot prove their souls remain intact.&#10;&#10;There are many dynamic strategies to experiment with across each playing. Will you sell pieces of your soul early on to boost your city-building prowess at the risk of future punishment from the Inquisition? Or will you carefully manage loan and debt repayment while waiting for others to inadvertently reveal their nefarious nature? Every choice has a consequence, and each role has its own unique strategic approach to explore.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DNZyEyGSihEgliX9fZ2Beg__original/img/A-sQYa16LLPwNXCseL_OZqH9XTo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6972703.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DNZyEyGSihEgliX9fZ2Beg__thumb/img/9DSN6z2c7o7aqYN97eDWM2WEDNg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6972703.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":160,"mechanics":["Deduction","Events","Income","Loans","Trading","Voting"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":5.8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Matúš Kotry"],"publishers":["Czech Games Edition"],"artists":["David Cochard"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
