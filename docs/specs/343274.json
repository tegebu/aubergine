{"gameId":343274,"name":"Cryptid: Urban Legends","description":"There's something hiding among us, a creature hitherto undiscovered prowling our very streets. If you track it down, well, that'd be the discovery of the century!&#10;&#10;Play as a determined scientist manipulating heat, movement, and sonic sensors to scan the city, identify your quarry's true location, and capture them &mdash; or take the role of a cryptid, snaking your way through shadows and back alleys of the metropolis that surrounds you, eliminating all evidence of your existence as you go, desperately avoiding capture. Emerging victorious in this high stakes cat-and-mouse chase, played out across a sprawling urban landscape, will require all your ingenuity and foresight.&#10;&#10;Cryptid: Urban Legends is a tense asymmetric game of competitive abstract deduction for two players from the creators of Cryptid.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_XzLyv4r9uB814N3L1y73A__original/img/Degd4_NNY5ajlWdaFja-sgNizZw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6303132.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_XzLyv4r9uB814N3L1y73A__thumb/img/jGtHofGLuXCs_RbhFXlIFCPVDKE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6303132.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Grid Movement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.27005,"rank":-1,"designers":["Hal Duncan","Ruth Veevers"],"publishers":["Osprey Games","Playagame Edizioni"],"artists":["Kwanchai Moriya"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
