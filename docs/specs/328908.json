{"gameId":328908,"name":"The Initiative","description":"The Initiative &mdash; a unique co-operative board game of story, strategy, and code-breaking &mdash; lets players take on the role of teenagers in 1994 who have found a mysterious board game called &quot;The Key&quot;. Not only will they play The Key, but players will help the teens through a pivotal chapter of their lives by following a series of missions linked together via an interactive comic book.&#10;&#10;The game's campaign is broken into a number of chapters, each taking 30-60 minutes to complete and each starting with you reading a page of the comic book. The story advances even if players fail a mission, but winning may provide a reward in the future. Each chapter builds on the knowledge and story from previous chapters, weaving narrative, code-breaking, and mystery into one thrilling game experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VbJ4TS-lQOE3Ki0oVkiIEA__original/img/dClCc89bwIyltiLlCQBhWQqZtH8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5910298.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VbJ4TS-lQOE3Ki0oVkiIEA__thumb/img/WqCgbbTu9axrozorQh9YFhPLIkI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5910298.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Area Movement","Cooperative Game","Deduction","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":6.34065,"averageRating":7.68928,"rank":1435,"designers":["Corey Konieczka"],"publishers":["Unexpected Games","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","Asmodee Spain","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","Hobby World"],"artists":["David Ardila","Chan Chau","Andrew Brian George"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":16,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":5,"recommended":20,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":14,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":23,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
