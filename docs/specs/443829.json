{"gameId":443829,"name":"Wriggle Roulette","description":"In Wriggle Roulette, players take turns reaching into a bag filled with eel- and snake-shaped wooden pieces, trying to pull out as many eels as possible &mdash; but if the number of snakes grabbed by all players exceeds the limit, a &quot;snake outbreak&quot; occurs, and the player who grabbed the most pieces loses all of their eels.&#10;&#10;You want to grab more than everyone else to score big, yet a snake outbreak would be devastating. Will you grab a bunch? Just a few? Or back out entirely? Read your opponents' expressions and control your own greed to make the right call.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/skXRM_7Bmo1EUyhASUejhw__original/img/GAWo7V2w_a4ENdga_2uKf4yMv94=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8821050.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/skXRM_7Bmo1EUyhASUejhw__thumb/img/NEGk94CExEduy9xslMnlZAXH2tA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8821050.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":20,"mechanics":["Push Your Luck"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.05385,"rank":-1,"designers":["Bruno Faidutti","Jun Sasaki"],"publishers":["Oink Games"],"artists":["Jun Sasaki"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":8,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":8,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
