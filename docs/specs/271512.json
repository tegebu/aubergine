{"gameId":271512,"name":"5211","description":"5211 is a fast-playing card game with a unique scoring method that rewards clever play!&#10;&#10;This game has cards 1-6 in five colors. Each player starts with a hand of five cards. Players play two cards face-down, then simultaneously reveal them. They refill their hand, then repeat this process two more times, but only with one card.&#10;&#10;The cards of the majority color will score &mdash; unless too many are present, in which case the color busts and the second most color scores. In case of a tie for majority, the tied colors are also out. These rounds are repeated until the deck runs out. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;5211 is a new edition of 5 COLORS that has all new art.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fm2SAoNjPi34jLFEJ9BXfA__original/img/u8ELFpVAPJYF0Hceett8Tv2J9cQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4560166.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fm2SAoNjPi34jLFEJ9BXfA__thumb/img/wpTkSUdq1h96at87h5P5CJ_sC7E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4560166.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Pattern Recognition","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":5.86453,"averageRating":6.36573,"rank":3427,"designers":["Tsuyoshi Hashiguchi (はしぐち つよし)"],"publishers":["Next Move Games","Asmodee","Ghenos Games","Pegasus Spiele","Plan B Games","Zvezda"],"artists":["Chris Quilliams"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":13,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":10,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":6,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
