{"gameId":411894,"name":"Kinfire Council","description":"Kinfire Council is a competitive game of strategy and politics. As a member of the Council, you've been charged with rebuilding the great city of Din'Lux and defending it from the dangers of the Starless Nights.&#10;&#10;Take turns sending your workers to collect resources, upgrade buildings, and construct new Kinfire lighthouses in the surrounding area, while the Cult of Altan interferes with your plans and undermines your authority. You'll vote on important city policies, arrest cultists, and dispatch your Seeker to thwart threats looming over the final bastion of civilization, the great city of Din'Lux.&#10;&#10;While you vie for power among yourselves, you also track the Cult's progress. If they win the game, then the Cult Conspirator ends up being the victor.  Will you be a benevolent leader, working together with your fellow Council members, or will your plans take a more sinister turn?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BlXCt-fbTsJLRbp_-65aKg__original/img/RoOm47p1lCfpg1Gy38sZXPpNA5A=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8953815.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BlXCt-fbTsJLRbp_-65aKg__thumb/img/au-olemEA-C_l--qyU05Dlgo-_M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8953815.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Voting","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.55221,"averageRating":7.98156,"rank":12373,"designers":["Kevin Wilson"],"publishers":["Incredible Dream Studios"],"artists":["Katarzyna Bekus","Sandra Chlewi≈Ñska","Wiktor Kozyra"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
