{"gameId":265736,"name":"Tiny Towns","description":"You are the mayor of a tiny town in the forest in which the smaller creatures of the woods have created a civilization hidden away from predators. This new land is small and the resources are scarce, so you take what you can get and never say no to building materials. Cleverly plan and construct a thriving town, and don't let it fill up with wasted resources! Whoever builds the most prosperous tiny town wins!&#10;&#10;In Tiny Towns, your town is represented by a 4x4 grid on which you will place resource cubes in specific layouts to construct buildings. Each building scores victory points (VPs) in a unique way. When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends, and any squares without a building are worth -1 VP. The player with the most VP wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__original/img/-GDAsvmQ3wkuHaZ8h9G5Gk_nvVA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4460401.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__thumb/img/AI-Ro3wLJtpyZLmCMNywOlpz0S8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4460401.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Follow","Grid Coverage","Pattern Building","Player Elimination","Solo / Solitaire Game","Square Grid","Turn Order: Progressive","Variable Phase Order","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":7.00338,"averageRating":7.20259,"rank":478,"designers":["Peter McPherson"],"publishers":["Alderac Entertainment Group","All In Games","Arrakis Games","Broadway Toys LTD","CMON Global Limited","Fractal Juegos","GaGa Games","Galápagos Jogos","Hid Konem (Хід Конем)","Korea Boardgames","Lanlalen","Lord of Boards","Lucky Duck Games","Pegasus Spiele","Raven Distribution","Reflexshop","REXhry","White Goblin Games","株式会社ケンビル (KenBill)"],"artists":["Gong Studios","Matt Paquette & Co."],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":25,"recommended":101,"notRecommended":55,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":55,"recommended":158,"notRecommended":29,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":129,"recommended":91,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":96,"recommended":103,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":27,"recommended":102,"notRecommended":61,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":18,"recommended":67,"notRecommended":91,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":3,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":102,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
