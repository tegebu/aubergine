{"gameId":359871,"name":"Arcs","description":"Arcs is a sharp sci-fi strategy game for 2&ndash;4 players, set in a dark yet silly universe. Players represent officials from a distant, decaying and neglectful Empire  who are now free to vie for dominance whether through battle, gathering scarce resources or diplomatic intrigue. Ready yourself for dramatic twists and turns as you launch into this galactic struggle.&#10;&#10;Seize the initiative: &#10;Take actions with multi-use cards. Copy the leader, pivot to new tactics, or take the initiative for next round. Timing is everything.&#10;&#10;Declare ambitions: &#10;In each round, you define the objectives that everyone competes over to win.&#10;&#10;Crush your foes: &#10;Amass your navy for battle, plan your strategy with three kinds of dice, then roll them all at once to resolve the battle in a flash.&#10;&#10;Each game contains a hundred wooden ships and agents, 18 custom engraved dice, a beautiful six-panel board, and tons of cards with over 60 pieces of unique art. The base game may be played without the optional Leaders and Lore cards (for an easier teach) or with them for a richer, fuller and asymmetric game. It is also the core of the campaign game (requiring the Blighted Reach Expansion), which provides an epic, more thematic experience.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XWImAu_3RK61wbzcKboVdA__original/img/43ianMZOks7UHlZILx0VBRntOmM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8145530.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XWImAu_3RK61wbzcKboVdA__thumb/img/Ry-6KHwNgERWadyxs1X1_P3dMvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8145530.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Die Icon Resolution","Hand Management","Negotiation","Trick-taking","Turn Order: Claim Action","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":7.32384,"averageRating":8.26008,"rank":212,"designers":["Cole Wehrle"],"publishers":["Leder Games","Matagot","Spielworxx"],"artists":["Kyle Ferrin"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":148,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":20,"recommended":121,"notRecommended":46,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":154,"recommended":66,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":116,"recommended":97,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":115,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
