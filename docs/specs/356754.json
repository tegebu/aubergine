{"gameId":356754,"name":"Tamashii: Chronicle of Ascend","description":"Tamashii is a cyberpunk adventure board game with a post-apocalyptic vibe. Players will struggle to survive and pursue their agendas in two worlds at the same time - the physical one, filled with deadly machines and merciless human survivors, and the virtual one, prowled by tracking software and vicious viruses.&#10;&#10;Players will try to achieve their goals on a modular city map. They will find new locations, fight against strong enemies and search for important information and files needed to win the game.&#10;&#10;The second part of the game takes action on a virtual map. Here you will try to hack your opponents, unlock special bonuses or get one-time bonuses for completing the sequences.&#10;&#10;The game may be played in different scenarios. You might have to cooperate with other players, play against them or even make an alliances with your enemies. But watch every step you take; every conflict, cooperation or alliance might be a double-edged sword.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tEWwLPGsNpFfVWelHtI1LA__original/img/aox6MovttayqzCXh-a19r-5JKUE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6692866.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tEWwLPGsNpFfVWelHtI1LA__thumb/img/AYTMNY0LXJNe_oQqxzwkpnOtvns=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6692866.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Grid Movement","Slide/Push","Square Grid"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.16667,"rank":-1,"designers":["Kamil 'Sanex' Cieśla","Robert Plesowicz","Łukasz Włodarczyk"],"publishers":["Awaken Realms Lite"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
