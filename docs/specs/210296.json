Once collected, players can build fences, various park facilities and populate their parks with dinosaurs.  Parks with the most prestigious dinosaurs will attract the most visitors.  But beware; if dinosaurs are neglected or improperly penned, they will attempt to escape and spread havoc through the entire park.&#10;&#10;Use all the tools at your disposal; DNA splice mutant dinosaurs, exploit the Black Market or just try to run an honest park, the choices are yours.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to lead your corporation to victory?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BukgjRWfkGfdLYGkLXExSw__original/img/QuSfGw28p46cQTtnW4C1bcEE98E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4524562.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BukgjRWfkGfdLYGkLXExSw__thumb/img/6m_qe2xeTZ4LeBzUIQB4qBlPf8A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4524562.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Events","Hand Management","Set Collection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Stat-Based","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2019,"bggRating":6.61018,"averageRating":7.59792,"rank":1011,"designers":["Richard Keene"],"publishers":["Ninth Haven Games","La Bo√Æte de Jeu"],"artists":["Nikola Matkovic","Grzegorz Pedrycz","Tan Ho Sim"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":30,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":27,"recommended":21,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":32,"recommended":15,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":12,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":24,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
