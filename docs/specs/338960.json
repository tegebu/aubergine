{"gameId":338960,"name":"Slay the Spire: The Board Game","description":"Slay the Spire: The Board Game is a co-operative deck-building, dungeon-crawling adventure. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of immense power, and finally become strong enough to slay the Spire!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a character with unique abilities and a simple deck of cards that they can improve by adding and removing cards during the game. Slay the Spire is also a rogue-like. That means that when you die (and you will die!), start over from the beginning. Take the lessons you learned and try again!&#10;&#10;The game is divided into Acts. At the end of an Act you can continue, stop and end the adventure there, or save and continue another time!&#10;&#10;If players defeat the final Boss, they win the game! Which Boss you consider to be final depends on how many Acts you want to play. You can stop playing at the end of any Act! When a player&rsquo;s HP is reduced to 0, they are dead and the party loses the game.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PQzVclEoOQ_wr4e1V86kxA__original/img/KXOf1hP1cIJQLabKhZulWP-e9wI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8157856.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PQzVclEoOQ_wr4e1V86kxA__thumb/img/cpmsSDagE5RvQ1ERXl-fMJIaUUg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8157856.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":150,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":7.80565,"averageRating":8.69886,"rank":42,"designers":["Gary Dworetsky","Anthony Giovannetti","Casey Yano"],"publishers":["Contention Games","Ediciones MasQueOca","Grok Games","Korea Boardgames","Lavka Games","Nice Game Publishing","Portal Games","Yayoi The Dreamer","YOKA Games"],"artists":["Bruce Brenneise","Jose David Lanza Cebrian","Anailis Dorta"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":51,"recommended":119,"notRecommended":26,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":148,"recommended":57,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":67,"recommended":108,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":26,"recommended":102,"notRecommended":50,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":131,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
