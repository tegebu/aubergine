{"gameId":437247,"name":"Nanty Narking: The Rise of Cthulhu","description":"A veil of darkness and despair has shrouded London. The natural order of things is shifting. The Great Old Ones emerge from the never-lifting mist, bent on taking over the feeble minds of humans &ndash; and each has its own purpose, a malevolent goal to fulfill. Rejoice as London descends into madness, and reshape it into your own ghastly image!&#10;&#10;Nanty Narking: Rise of the Cthulhu is a dynamic expansion for Nanty Narking that allows 2-4 players to become a Great Old One of myths. Summon lesser gods and entities to do your bidding, help you achieve your secret goal, and battle with other powerful Great Old Ones, equally as hell-bent on total domination and destruction.&#10;&#10;The expansion introduces new components &ndash; including Great Ones' giant miniatures &ndash; and a slew of new mechanisms. You'll take on the personalities of Great Old Ones, and use new card abilities: Insanity, to ramp up the madness level, and Summon, to beckon lesser entities to join you. Each such Great One is a unique agent with powerful ability, difficult to eliminate and eager to sow destruction, now easier and more fun than ever. But beware &ndash; if you overdo it and the Doomsday track is filled, you all lose!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7x_Gt6wxXssJALaCj0XyKQ__original/img/BORUOizFqCITk1AkVpufINj-6_4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8676830.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7x_Gt6wxXssJALaCj0XyKQ__thumb/img/9nIubWtbZp6cXLawyqCmCKxCcS4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8676830.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action / Event","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Events","Hand Management","Hidden Roles","Interrupts","Roles with Asymmetric Information","Take That"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Valdemar Gumienny","Martin Wallace"],"publishers":["PHALANX"],"artists":["Bartek Jędrzejewski","Grzegorz Ryszko","Jakub Skop","Miłosz Wojtasik"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
