{"gameId":251747,"name":"Atlantic Chase","description":"&quot;Atlantic Chase&quot; simulates the naval campaigns fought in the North Atlantic between the surface fleets of the Royal Navy and the Kriegsmarine between 1939 and 1942. It utilizes a system of trajectories to model the fog of war that bedeviled the commands during this period. Just as the pins and strings adorning Churchill&rsquo;s wall represented the course of the ships underway, players arrange trajectory lines across the shared game board, each line representing a task force&rsquo;s path of travel. Without resorting to dummy blocks, hidden movement, or a double-blind system requiring a referee or computer, players experience the uncertainty endemic to this period of naval warfare.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yWfwJMAXFJSzTL1q64T1Fw__original/img/_N4Bzh8Gc7jDZLlAiAng8hD3NqM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5684788.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yWfwJMAXFJSzTL1q64T1Fw__thumb/img/OGC7ljhxXQ9Y3EAMUq0m8HTiQkc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5684788.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.59043,"averageRating":8.46893,"rank":7534,"designers":["Jeremy White"],"publishers":["GMT Games"],"artists":["Jeremy White"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
