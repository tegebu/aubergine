{"gameId":394094,"name":"Snow Planner","description":"Snow Planner is a dice-placement game for 2-4 players who each take the role of managing an inn near snowy mountains. Players take turns placing a die on the game board, and once all the dice are gone, the round ends.&#10;&#10;You will invite guests to stay at your hotel, with them paying you at the end of a round and ideally staying additional nights so that you don't have to find more guests. By placing tiles on your board, you upgrade the hotel, increasing bonuses and earning more income. Dice can also represent employees, who gain you resources with their work time; additional dice can be earned, both permanent and part-time.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one of the talent cards, giving them unique powers during the game. By using this power and their dice, players can fulfill goals and projects or attract VIP guests.&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever earns the most points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lnwW4RzOzRSlDzg422HyAA__original/img/sERUAhBF7785YG8FNRa8xkCWCNM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7622626.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lnwW4RzOzRSlDzg422HyAA__thumb/img/E6069LvksHgmSsvB7jCqZ03eFYg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7622626.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Simulation","Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6,"rank":-1,"designers":["Akashi"],"publishers":["(Self-Published)"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
