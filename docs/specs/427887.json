{"gameId":427887,"name":"Castle Builder","description":"The barons are trying to impress each other and the king by building beautiful castles. When you place tiles to your castle, your baron moves around a path to collect bonuses, and the first to reach 7 coins wins the game. Build high to move more, and add features like windows and tiled roofs to gain even more bonuses along the way.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you either draw 2 tiles to your tile holder ('hand'), or you build a tile to your castle, either from your hand or from the shared market. Depending on what tile you build and where, your baron gets to move a certain number of steps. If you land on an opponent, you pass it for free! If you land on a bonus, you collect it, and if you land on or pass a coin bonus, you take a coin from the coin market. Each coin has an immediate 1-time effect, and the first to reach 7 coins wins the game. An example of a coin effect can be: 'The player with most windows on the castle draws 2 tiles'. This enhances competition and the importance of timing.&#10;&#10;When building, your tile number must be the sum of the 2 tiles it is built on, rewarding careful planning. +-1 adjustments can be paid for. Some tiles can be placed on any number, but often limit how you can continue upwards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yoxCg_M1y1CeSoKsUKAyOA__original/img/ZhuflZST8QUZoibuPOWSZ6Jo0qI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8394502.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yoxCg_M1y1CeSoKsUKAyOA__thumb/img/6htfXTcJHve3z_wfxMQ3YPa9s-c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8394502.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Market","Pattern Building","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.5,"rank":-1,"designers":["Daniel Fryxelius"],"publishers":["FryxGames","Intrafin Games","Kilogames"],"artists":["Naomi Fryxelius"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
