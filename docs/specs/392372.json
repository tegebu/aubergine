You're lucky they chose to use the roads &ndash; you can overtake them using the shortcut. A few hours, two terrified settlements, and one totally honorable saber duel later, you are here. The village looks boring, but there is an old, pagan chapel, seemingly sealed tightly. Sneaking in is not an option, so it's time to get these doors open!&#10;&#10;Get inside the chapel and reach for treasure before others!
