{"gameId":417197,"name":"Rebirth","description":"After periods of upheaval, humanity has found ways to prosper in harmony with nature. A new age of restoration begins. Scotland lies in ruins, and clans vie for social prestige as they contribute to bringing the land to new glory.&#10;&#10;Rebirth is an old-school tile-laying Eurogame from Reiner Knizia with modern sensibilities. Rebirth revitalizes this classic genre with streamlined mechanisms that are combined with a signature Mighty Boards evocative vision &mdash; one of a lush, cosy, and hopeful future.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player draws a tile from their own face-down pile and chooses where on the board to place it. This tile represents that turn's contribution to the restoration. As the board fills up, the game reveals its subtle, strategic intricacies, greatly rewarding foresight, planning, and clever tactical play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VV1bnG4fskX9u6Bx9nf04g__original/img/gVWyYMFyl6jNrY8XLyToL7grsjo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8113601.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VV1bnG4fskX9u6Bx9nf04g__thumb/img/1m-dh8rZsFMIEgbD-C6RDIhZmD4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8113601.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["Mighty Boards"],"artists":["Anna \"Mikado\" Przybylska","Katarzyna Redesiuk"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
