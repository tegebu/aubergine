Logistics were the key to either failure or success.&#10;&#10;In 1941: Race to Moscow, you take command of one of the three German Army groups and advance towards Moscow! The game is based on the system used in 1944: Race to the Rhine, but the gameplay is much deeper. Armies are divided into armored and non-motorized, transports composed of trucks and trains. And the enemy &mdash; the Soviet army &mdash; is terribly strong.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4b-6UoD1xfl27l2SD18KRg__original/img/mFCHdLbKCGx1a2Cre_A7dSqQD68=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6715708.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4b-6UoD1xfl27l2SD18KRg__thumb/img/fx9M0yqQuR_9AA6taX6hkj3sGDI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6715708.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Network and Route Building","Pick-up and Deliver","Point to Point Movement","Race","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.60062,"averageRating":7.33993,"rank":7556,"designers":["Waldek Gumienny"],"publishers":["ASYNCRON games","PHALANX"],"artists":["Bartek JÄ™drzejewski","Grzegorz Ryszko"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
