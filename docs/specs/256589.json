{"gameId":256589,"name":"Rallyman: GT","description":"Start your Engines!&#10;&#10;Rallyman is a Roll and Move game with a simple yet exciting dice mechanic that invites players to push their luck and navigate the terrain as best they can.&#10;&#10;Will you take a risk and squeeze every last second out of the track, or will you play it cool and avoid spinning out on hard corners, bumps and other treacherous terrain?&#10;&#10;Holy Grail Games will be reimagining this classic 2009 racing board game. The first edition and its expansion Rallyman: Dirt not only sold out completely but in doing so federated a community that has continued to play to this day. Hosting monthly challenges, championships and even a World Cup, Rallyman has continued to survive in the heart of its devoted community despite being officially out of print for over 6 years. Now, Holy Grail Games will be bringing back this cult game for both new and veteran players in the form of Rallyman: GT!&#10;&#10;The main changes from the old edition are:&#10;&#10;     Hexagon based track tiles that give you complete freedom to build your own tracks!&#10;     a head to head racing system where you'll have to outdrive your opponents on the way to the finish line.&#10;     Larger scale tracks and cars for a better playing experience.&#10;     All new artwork from award winning illustrator Loic Muzy.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game's exciting core mechanics remained unchanged however and time attack mode will be back as a solo variant!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kbM9yrDsWSfN7O054urxlA__original/img/yXa6ktBozGxJxZQP7zF-wN1eShk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4350196.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kbM9yrDsWSfN7O054urxlA__thumb/img/x6YrgrrpBJ-K3oYRYjv1BTf5tWQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4350196.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Different Dice Movement","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Push Your Luck","Race","Roll / Spin and Move","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":6.56112,"averageRating":7.25441,"rank":1037,"designers":["Jean-Christophe Bouvier"],"publishers":["Holy Grail Games","Synapses Games","ADC Blackfire Entertainment","BoardM Factory","Czacha Games","Delta Vision Publishing","Galápagos Jogos"],"artists":["Loïc Muzy"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":8,"recommended":30,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":2,"recommended":31,"notRecommended":16,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":15,"recommended":33,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":42,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":24,"recommended":22,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":12,"recommended":24,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":29,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
