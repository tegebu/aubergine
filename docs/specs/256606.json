{"gameId":256606,"name":"Spirits of the Wild","description":"Spirits of the Wild is a stone-taking game for two players. The object of the game is to earn the most points by collecting sets of colorful stones from a central bowl and giving them to the five animals on your score board.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you use action cards to draw or add stones to the bowl, use powerful spirit abilities, or send Coyote to distract your opponent. Always the trickster, Coyote prevents your opponent from giving stones to an animal of your choice, which might be just what you need to take the lead.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five spirit stones are released from the bag. Add up the points you gained for each animal, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3x2kFEjL0qygSNU2w9T0qQ__original/img/je95EGvN9aS1vEbyre5l66YZl3M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5521767.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3x2kFEjL0qygSNU2w9T0qQ__thumb/img/tKTqxcZNBnX_8xgQ11NwZqMLjQY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5521767.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Hand Management","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2018,"bggRating":6.46952,"averageRating":7.33365,"rank":1327,"designers":["Nick Hayes"],"publishers":["Mattel, Inc."],"artists":["Syd Weiler"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":26,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":29,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":25,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
