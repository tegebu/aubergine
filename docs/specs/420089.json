To sneak into your neighboring mage&rsquo;s yard to yoink their gnomes, while keeping another rival mage from snagging yours, it&rsquo;s going to take both powers you&rsquo;ve got. Harness your horticulture magic to gather the greatest gnome collection!&#10;&#10;- Construct a magical(ish) hedge maze to keep your gnomes in!&#10;- Navigate your neighbor&rsquo;s ever-growing labyrinth!&#10;- Enchant neighboring gnomes, spark them to life, and steal them away to victory!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQnlCiv_X0GlYDFExng4EQ__original/img/KhUxMVfORLtTcHbJTJXqiM2hZ7M=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8223768.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQnlCiv_X0GlYDFExng4EQ__thumb/img/3copFCOhkKhCVHMCpFXOvuec3hk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8223768.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Movement Points","Moving Multiple Units","Pick-up and Deliver","Simultaneous Action Selection","Tile Placement","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.33333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Connor Wake"],"publishers":["Floodgate Games"],"artists":["Josh Nelson"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
