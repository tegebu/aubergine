{"gameId":395623,"name":"Harvest","description":"Salutations, neighbor, and welcome to Furroughfield, the Commonwealth of Free Beasts! Ours is a budding farm town with soil ripe for planting.&#10;&#10;In Harvest, you take on the role of a farmer, each with their own unique penchant for working the land, and choose a farmhouse with its own special round-to-round benefit. Each round, you draft sunrise cards that give you a one-time income and determine turn order for the round. Following that turn order, move your wheelbarrows around town to gather resources that you'll use to manage your fields. Plant seeds, tend the land, and harvest crops to make money and score points. Clear land to expand your farm, and construct buildings that make your land more efficient and give you endgame bonuses. By the end of harvest season, the farmer with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GY6u68JwrMHKNDxRkyaZAg__original/img/WORSJBgHkxOyc67_NaY4S9WpOtQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7696599.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GY6u68JwrMHKNDxRkyaZAg__thumb/img/bcgNy8nfsP8F7ZGpaL9wJiaSE2w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7696599.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Open Drafting","Variable Player Powers","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":6.04274,"averageRating":7.59424,"rank":2731,"designers":["Trey Chambers"],"publishers":["Keymaster Games"],"artists":["Tierra Connor"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":5,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":16,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":14,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":4,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":8,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
