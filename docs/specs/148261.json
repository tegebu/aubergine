{"gameId":148261,"name":"SeaFall","description":"SeaFall is a 4X-inspired game (without player elimination/extermination) set in an &quot;age of sail&quot; world reminiscent of our world.&#10;&#10;In SeaFall, the world is starting to claw its way out of a dark age and has begun to rediscover seafaring technology. Players take on the role of a mainland empire that consults with a consortium of advisors to discover new islands, explore those islands, develop trade, send out raiding parties, take part in ship-to-ship combat, and more. As in Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy, co-designed by Rob Daviau, SeaFall evolves as the game is played, setting their grudges into the history of the game and building a different narrative at every table as players open up the world.&#10;&#10;Due to the complexity of rules interactions in this game, the community (primarily Becq) has created a FAQ called The Captain&#039;s Log.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8NYsQTJuPs_XVN2x1PdT4A__original/img/msI3oIsaN1sccC-KIs0FbVn3gNQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3571648.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8NYsQTJuPs_XVN2x1PdT4A__thumb/img/KBNn5qIs2qJeS9n3Fit7KbvYgeg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3571648.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Legacy Game","Trading","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2016,"bggRating":5.84989,"averageRating":6.16513,"rank":4117,"designers":["Rob Daviau"],"publishers":["IronWall Games","Cube Factory of Ideas","Devir","Filosofia Éditions","Galápagos Jogos","Heidelberger Spieleverlag","Plaid Hat Games"],"artists":["Jared Blando","EJ Dela Cruz","Rob Daviau","Jen Santos","Brian Valeza"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":9,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":84,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":4,"recommended":18,"notRecommended":75,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":25,"recommended":58,"notRecommended":17,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":54,"recommended":33,"notRecommended":15,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":18,"recommended":32,"notRecommended":53,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":73,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
