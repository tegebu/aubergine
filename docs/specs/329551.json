{"gameId":329551,"name":"Mosaic: A Story of Civilization","description":"Mosaic: A Story of Civilization is a Civilization-Building game from Glenn Drover, designer of, among others, Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery, Railways of the World, Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame, and Raccoon Tycoon.&#10;&#10;Mosaic is an action selection game. On your turn, you will perform one of eight actions and acquire pillars of civilization.&#10;&#10;Acquiring pillars is important in creating the unique mosaic of your civilization. They are used as prerequisites for many new technologies, as well as for scoring. Also, by pursuing specialization in one or more civilization pillars, you may be able to claim a &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; of that type.&#10;&#10;As the game goes on and your civilization grows, scoring cards are eventually revealed from the four decks. Each time a scoring card is revealed, your civilization will score for each region that you dominate with your cities, towns, wonders, and military units. After the third scoring card is revealed, there is one final turn and the game ends. You will then score for your cities and towns, your wonders, projects, achievments, and golden ages, and for all of your cards that score for your unique civilization pillars.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher (corrected and updated)&#10;&#10;Please note that the solo rules are only included in the Kickstarter editions, not in the retail versions (although they are available as print-and-play in French at the very least).&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRym3ngIdndJT2hhOURjMw__original/img/wnMrlWn4cdXgkG3fB1JYDqFNqJc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7414594.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRym3ngIdndJT2hhOURjMw__thumb/img/XWJj-SqoPA1eh6u7KUY1j3nSEA8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7414594.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Area Majority / Influence","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Open Drafting","Set Collection","Tags","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.78289,"averageRating":7.60142,"rank":713,"designers":["Glenn Drover"],"publishers":["Forbidden Games","Arrakis Games","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","Pendragon Game Studio","Portal Games","Sylex"],"artists":["Jared Blando","Hendrik Noack","Jacoby O'Connor","Grzegorz Pedrycz","Jessica Riola","Erica Rossi","Annie Stegg"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":42,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":8,"recommended":34,"notRecommended":43,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":23,"recommended":39,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":44,"recommended":29,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":10,"recommended":36,"notRecommended":17,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":5,"recommended":24,"notRecommended":34,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":40,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
