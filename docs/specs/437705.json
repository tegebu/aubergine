{"gameId":437705,"name":"Horrified: Dungeons & Dragons","description":"Terror is in the eye of the beholder! Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons will not only set players against four of the classic role-playing game's most fearsome foes, but will also introduce new gameplay elements inspired by the mechanisms of D&amp;D, including the use of a 20-sided die.&#10;&#10;Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons features gameplay elements familiar to players of other games in the series: Players work together to face monsters and puzzle-like obstacles to gather item tokens, protect citizens, and avoid attacks. Unique and thematic challenges for each monster further immerse players into the detailed setting and story. Additionally, each player chooses to play as one of five heroes inspired by character classes from D&amp;D: wizard, rogue, fighter, cleric, or bard &mdash; each with a unique set of abilities that can aid their party as they move around the board to defeat the monsters dwelling in the dungeon below Waterdeep.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Drv6TfMDsEfjbau5ycKd7g__original/img/dBOutMc_CShuvv9fJk4vmChxooU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8718235.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Drv6TfMDsEfjbau5ycKd7g__thumb/img/ofdl6XEcgUvqZGbcKI4z_URbxvA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8718235.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Pick-up and Deliver","Point to Point Movement","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.44091,"rank":-1,"designers":["Peter Lee"],"publishers":["Ravensburger"],"artists":["Sam Dawson"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
