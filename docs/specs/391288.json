{"gameId":391288,"name":"Firefly: The Game â€“ 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition","description":"In Firefly: The Game &ndash; based on the popular Firefly television series created by Joss Whedon &ndash; players captain their own Firefly-class transport ship, traveling the 'Verse with a handpicked crew of fighters, mechanics and other travelers. As a captain desperate for work, players are compelled to take on any job &mdash; so long as it pays. Double-dealing employers, heavy-handed Alliance patrols, and marauding Reavers are all in a day's work for a ship's captain at the edge of the 'Verse.&#10;&#10;Players begin with a ship, and travel from planet to planet, hiring crew, purchasing ship upgrades, and picking up cargo to deliver (jobs) all in the form of cards. Some crew and cargo are illegal, and can be confiscated if your ship is boarded by an alliance vessel. Traveling from planet to planet requires turning over &quot;full burn&quot; cards, one for each space moved. Most do nothing, but you can also encounter an Alliance ship, have a breakdown, or even run into Reavers. Completing jobs gets you cash. First player to complete the story goals wins!&#10;&#10;Firefly: The Game &ndash; 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition is the whole 'Verse in a box.
