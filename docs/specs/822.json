{"gameId":822,"name":"Carcassonne","description":"Carcassonne is a tile placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape represented on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his/her meeples in one of the areas on it: in the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, in the cloister as a monk, or in the field as a farmer. When that area is complete that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him/her a hard time to complete his/her project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__original/img/aVZEXAI-cUtuunNfPhjeHlS4fwQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6544250.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__thumb/img/88274KiOg94wziybVHyW8AeOiXg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6544250.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Enclosure","Map Addition","Pattern Building","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2000,"bggRating":7.29598,"averageRating":7.41115,"rank":230,"designers":["Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"],"publishers":["Hans im Glück","999 Games","Albi","Astrel Games","Bard Centrum Gier","Brain Games","cutia.ro","Devir","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma)","Fantasmagoria","Feelindigo","Filosofia Éditions","Giochi Uniti","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos","Hobby World","Ísöld ehf.","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames","Lautapelit.fi","Midgaard Games","MINDOK","Möbius Games","Monkey Time","NeoTroy Games","Nordic Games ehf","Paper Iyagi","Piatnik","Ponva d.o.o.","Rio Grande Games","Schmidt Spiele","Smart Ltd","Stupor Mundi","SuperHeated Neurons","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Venice Connection","Ventura Games","Z-Man Games"],"artists":["Marcel Gröber","Doris Matthäus","Anne Pätzke","Chris Quilliams","Franz-Georg Stämmele"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":7,"recommended":78,"notRecommended":1613,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1380,"recommended":934,"notRecommended":124,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1150,"recommended":1130,"notRecommended":46,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":717,"recommended":1336,"notRecommended":184,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":196,"recommended":1062,"notRecommended":747,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":35,"recommended":243,"notRecommended":1332,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
