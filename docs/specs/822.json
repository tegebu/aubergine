{"gameId":822,"name":"Carcassonne","description":"Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__original/img/aVZEXAI-cUtuunNfPhjeHlS4fwQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6544250.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__thumb/img/88274KiOg94wziybVHyW8AeOiXg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6544250.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Map Addition","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2000,"bggRating":7.30227,"averageRating":7.41279,"rank":201,"designers":["Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"],"publishers":["Hans im Glück","999 Games","Albi","Asmodee Canada","Bard Centrum Gier","Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)","Brain Games","cutia.ro","Devir","Fantasmagoria","Feelindigo","Filosofia Éditions","Giochi Uniti","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos","Hobby World","Ísöld ehf.","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Lautapelit.fi","Midgaard Games","MINDOK","Möbius Games","Monkey Time","NeoTroy Games","Nordic Games ehf","Paper Iyagi","Piatnik","Ponva d.o.o.","Rio Grande Games","Schmidt Spiele","Smart Ltd","Stupor Mundi","SuperHeated Neurons","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Venice Connection","Ventura Games","Z-Man Games"],"artists":["Marcel Gröber","Doris Matthäus","Anne Pätzke","Chris Quilliams","Franz-Georg Stämmele","Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":6,"recommended":70,"notRecommended":1426,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1236,"recommended":832,"notRecommended":113,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1013,"recommended":1033,"notRecommended":39,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":630,"recommended":1206,"notRecommended":162,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":169,"recommended":952,"notRecommended":673,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":31,"recommended":224,"notRecommended":1180,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
