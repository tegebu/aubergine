Fueled by the Uranium Revolution, a new era of prosperity is here. The rich, the powerful, the free spirited... They all want a slice of the new life. Lucky for them, the energy consortiums working all over the planet, from Saxony to Australia, are more than happy to sell a few shares for extra investments.

But no one can reach their heights with ambition only. Powerful Patrons are here, offering their wealth and knowledge to help you reach a new level and become the most respected entrepreneur of the time!&#10;&#10;Nucleum: Energy Research Institute is an expansion to the base game of Nucleum and brings to life 8 new Experiments, and Patron cards with powerful abilities.
