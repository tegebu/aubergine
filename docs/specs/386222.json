The world is damaged now, bearing the wounds of this impossible battle, but at the same time &ndash; we are free and responsible for our own fates for the first time.&#10;&#10;Yet from lands far away, followers of New Gods arrive with their true intent unknown, hidden behind their political agendas.&#10;&#10;Amongst all of this turmoil are you, a wild bunch of mercenaries, just blindly accepting another job&hellip;&#10;&#10;As you travel across the world, you will discover and scout unknown lands.
