{"gameId":387515,"name":"Kavango","description":"Travel to the vast wildernesses of Southern Africa and step into the role of a Conservation Expert. Embark on a re-wilding journey as you transform your own unique landscape into a thriving nature reserve. Over three fast-paced rounds of simultaneous turns and card drafting, you will build a flourishing ecosystem. As you grow your nature reserve, you must complete research tasks to earn money to invest in protection and provide a haven for vulnerable and endangered animals. As the game progresses, your choices become harder and your strategy more complex as you aim to build the highest scoring nature reserve.&#10;Created by Matt and Zara, while working on conservation in Botswana, Kavango is deeply thematic and is thoughtfully designed to be a modern and realistic view of conservation in southern Africa. With 160 unique species cards, 45 research cards, 10 conservation experts and 5 landscape boards, there is huge variability to reflect the incredible biodiversity of Kavango.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XjECtrE-qESpVUMCVD-TJQ__original/img/vDHKm_RYGFT6klQtxtRQ2ZpNVes=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7976828.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XjECtrE-qESpVUMCVD-TJQ__thumb/img/vdvT5TAjaELY3uCoFy-aGevbJxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7976828.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Closed Drafting","Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Hand Management","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.63638,"averageRating":8.47273,"rank":7204,"designers":["Matt Brown","Zara Reid"],"publishers":["Mazaza Games"],"artists":["Matt Brown"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":6,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":8,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":4,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
