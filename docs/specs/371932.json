{"gameId":371932,"name":"Explorers of Navoria","description":"In the magical land of Navoria, new and strange continents have emerged from the sea. The council of Navoria has decreed that the new continents must be explored, and you and a handful of other intrepid adventurers have answered the call... the stage is set for the adventure of a lifetime in Explorers of Navoria!&#10;&#10;In Explorers of Navoria, you'll take action tokens from the bag and use them to draft Adventure cards into your tableau.&#10;&#10;Adventure cards help you explore Navoria, build settlements in the newly emerged continents, craft supplies and items, and collaborate with the different races of Navoria.&#10;&#10;Some of the Adventure cards give instant benefits, boosting your powers; some give ongoing abilities, engine-building in your tableau; and all of them increase your reputation with different races of Navoria, unlocking end-game bonuses through set-collection.&#10;&#10;After drafting Adventure cards, you'll use the same tokens you drafted from the bag to visit locations on the mainland of Navoria in a worker placement phase. Worker placement locations reduce in power after each token is placed so you'll want to visit each location first to get the best benefits!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ytFv6aVdLQ4rNWxTlZhHlQ__original/img/M8rm24-ZpNTfkzSwpY2svdm-nAA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7598950.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ytFv6aVdLQ4rNWxTlZhHlQ__thumb/img/YotVsBbAnXKCyAYZ75Li81GWGRI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7598950.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":80,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","End Game Bonuses","Income","Set Collection","Track Movement","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.74038,"averageRating":7.56095,"rank":5195,"designers":["Meng Chunlin"],"publishers":["Qiling board game","Board Game Rookie","Dranda Games","GÃ©m Klub Kft.","HIT Games","Maldito Games","Strohmann Games","Sylex"],"artists":["Meng Chunlin"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":7,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":12,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
