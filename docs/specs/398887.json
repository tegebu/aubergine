{"gameId":398887,"name":"Hispania","description":"At the beginning of the 2nd century BC the Republic of Rome has just defeated its greatest nightmare, the Carthaginian Hannibal. After annexing the Carthaginian possessions on the Mediterranean coast of Hispania, Rome organizes them into the provinces Ulterior and Citerior and orders the corresponding praetors to complete the conquest of the peninsula, inhabited by peoples without cohesion. But these Hispaniards turn out to be a formidable enemy...&#10;&#10;HISPANIA is a cooperative game in which 1 to 3 players take the role of all the praetors and consuls that Rome sent to Hispania for almost 200 years, until the first emperor Caesar Augustus culminated the conquest with the final defeat of the Cantabrians and the incorporation of Hispania to his brand new Empire.&#10;&#10;The core engine is built upon that of TETRARCHIA, with several important changes (like Roman coins and roads) but a similar difficulty matrix that leads in this game to 243 different levels. On top of that, the game includes several modular expansions, historical scenarios, and a competitive mode that allows 1 additional player to lead the Hispanic resistance against Rome.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rho5EHTE7Srdmtl1GrFqJg__original/img/5aUo5Sjuex3BK7Qt6MMmBEWMvTM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7927851.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rho5EHTE7Srdmtl1GrFqJg__thumb/img/N3B08AKXlsr8vWjPwaaoNNlv30c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7927851.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Point to Point Movement","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.57307,"averageRating":8.42154,"rank":10316,"designers":["Miguel Marqués"],"publishers":["Draco Ideas"],"artists":["Paco Arenas","Miguel Marqués"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":4,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
