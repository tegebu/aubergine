{"gameId":307033,"name":"Space Marine Adventures: Rise of the Orks","description":"Rise of the Orks is a fast-paced base defense game for 1-5 players that pits a team of heroic Terminators against hordes of brutal greenskins. Working alone or with your friends, you&rsquo;ll fight desperate battles where luck, skill and teamwork are required to survive and prosper in this game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.&#10;&#10;This game builds on the Space Marine Adventures series, but revolves around defense instead of exploration. Similarly, each round, players will spend action points to move or attack the waves of Orks. Will you be able to defend the crucial shield generator? Or will the Orks triumph against the noble Space Marines?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/JScgSf0sbKJ7wczVwKdcEJQpqT0=/0x0/pic5603746.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/qfL1CG6VDbPqgRDLjuxqCzGhwvM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5603746.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.72222,"rank":-1,"designers":[],"publishers":["Games Workshop Ltd."],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
