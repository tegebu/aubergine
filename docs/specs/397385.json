{"gameId":397385,"name":"Pirates of Maracaibo","description":"Set sail for an adventurous raid, for perhaps it will be your last!  Face danger and adventure once more while you search high and low for the most valuable treasures the Caribbean has to offer.  Then, quickly find a safe harbor to stash priceless gold, rare emeralds and iridescent pearls.  Explore, stockpile cargo, hire crew, commandeer rival ships but don&rsquo;t forget to bury your loot.  As you sail, be on the lookout for a place to settle after your life on the high seas has come to an end.  It won&rsquo;t be easy&hellip; You&rsquo;ll have to outpace your opponents, as one trip around the Caribbean won&rsquo;t be enough.  You must make three trips in order to retire as the richest and greatest buccaneer of all time.&#10;&#10;Pirates of Maracaibo is standalone game in the same franchise as the popular game Maracaibo (2019).  Players who are familiar with Maracaibo will recognize some beloved concepts from the original.  However, new players can jump right in with no prior knowledge of the original game, as Pirates of Maracaibo is an independent game with a more accessible rule-set.  The game plays over three rounds; sail the Caribbean, hire crew, ally with other ships, explore the shore, amass the most treasure and retire to a secluded island as the most revered pirate in history.  Cast off sailors and swashbucklers, cast off!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vISHDWREDUZclWdyUb56vA__original/img/Q3Rc6iYr_jiI3EclJAkhO8B5zAU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7661931.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vISHDWREDUZclWdyUb56vA__thumb/img/iqrqTVO39xvnmZdz6ENb8Y5LX64=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7661931.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":100,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Increase Value of Unchosen Resources","Multi-Use Cards","Pieces as Map"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":10,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ralph Bienert","Ryan Hendrickson","Alexander Pfister"],"publishers":["dlp games","Game's Up"],"artists":["Fiore GmbH","Odysseas Stamoglou"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
