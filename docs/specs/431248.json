{"gameId":431248,"name":"For a Crown","description":"Coming from noble families, you are ready to do anything to accede to the throne...except that the competition between the pretenders is fierce!&#10;&#10;For a Crown is a single-deck, deck-building game. Players recruit new characters, such as mercenaries, then place these cards within a sleeve of their own color. All cards &mdash; individual player cards and common event cards &mdash; are shuffled into a single deck, which is then drawn card by card, with the relevant player resolving the effect of their card when it's revealed.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the player with the most rubies wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuXFlRVqispVT2yhiykDrw__original/img/yPoT3INxyDzr0OA2c-pY5wUTaFI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8495392.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuXFlRVqispVT2yhiykDrw__thumb/img/JR1KrA7k_bIEcSsPc6_ve5p85cg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8495392.png","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Deck Construction","Hidden Victory Points","Take That","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.60276,"averageRating":7.02161,"rank":8671,"designers":["Maxime Rambourg"],"publishers":["Repos Production","Hobby Japan","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Tower Tactic Games"],"artists":["Paul Mafayon"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":9,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
