{"gameId":365137,"name":"Spirit Island: Nature Incarnate","description":"Since time untold, Spirits have existed on the Island. There are Spirits whose names are known by the local Dahan people &mdash; Spirits of growth and fire, of strength and river. But these are not the only Spirits&hellip; Legends whispered on the rarest of days tell stories of Spirits from the deepest, furthest reaches of the land. Powerful forces of nature that have not been witnessed in ages.&#10;&#10;When white-sailed ships reach our coastal waters, when would-be colonizers step foot onto the unblighted shores, when they raise blade and plow to claim the land with greed and hunger, nature stirs. When Invaders strike out at the heart of the Island, they draw the attention of Spirits of myth and legend and face power unimaginable.&#10;&#10;This time, they learn to fear Nature Incarnate.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island: Nature Incarnate introduces eight new Spirits, twenty new aspects, and so much more.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hE1lnC_WJ4TFDkmjpucUbQ__original/img/Fc4tFMGEwr2vM7HDmghA1YxM6I0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8114391.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hE1lnC_WJ4TFDkmjpucUbQ__thumb/img/tO6Sje8PXYW-gFd9VU8i6O9yYEw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8114391.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Action Retrieval","Area Majority / Influence","Automatic Resource Growth","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Cooperative Game","Events","Hand Management","Modular Board","Set Collection","Simultaneous Action Selection","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.9235,"averageRating":9.33934,"rank":-1,"designers":["R.
