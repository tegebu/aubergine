{"gameId":380938,"name":"Archeos Society","description":"Guide your team in Archeos Society as you explore legendary sites! You must decide whether to form small expeditions for quick progression, or larger expeditions that are more efficient but slower to assemble.&#10;&#10;On each of your turns, you either recruit a new explorer or launch an expedition by playing your cards using a group of matching colors or roles. Choose your expedition leader wisely as they determine which region you explore and provide a special ability for that expedition. Note that whenever you launch an expedition, unplayed cards in your hand are made available for your opponents to recruit!&#10;&#10;To achieve victory, you must carefully manage your efforts in recruiting and accumulating discoveries, all while monitoring the progress of your competitors.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/92kBNvfOo7OsCh0evdKDPQ__original/img/b_MMC2xcvS4pDpc3dn1iCjSfOfc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7364080.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/92kBNvfOo7OsCh0evdKDPQ__thumb/img/IYWrx7j0lm_K4F44_EJr81Lven0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7364080.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Open Drafting","Push Your Luck","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.02304,"averageRating":7.14669,"rank":2823,"designers":["Paolo Mori"],"publishers":["Space Cowboys"],"artists":["John McCambridge"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":18,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":5,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":15,"recommended":6,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":4,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
