{"gameId":380938,"name":"Archeos Society","description":"Guide your team as you explore legendary Sites! You must decide whether to form small expeditions for quick progression, or larger expeditions, more efficient but slower to assemble.&#10;&#10;On each of your turns, you will either recruit a new explorer, or launch an expedition by playing your cards using a group of matching colors or roles. Choose your expedition leader wisely: they will determine which region your explore, and provide a special ability for that expedition.&#10;&#10;Note: whenever you launch an expedition, unplayed cards in your hand will be made available for your opponents to recruit!&#10;To achieve victory you must carefully manage your efforts in recruiting and accumulating discoveries, all while monitoring the progress of your competitors.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/92kBNvfOo7OsCh0evdKDPQ__original/img/b_MMC2xcvS4pDpc3dn1iCjSfOfc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7364080.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/92kBNvfOo7OsCh0evdKDPQ__thumb/img/IYWrx7j0lm_K4F44_EJr81Lven0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7364080.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Market","Open Drafting","Push Your Luck","Race","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.66667,"rank":-1,"designers":["Paolo Mori"],"publishers":["Space Cowboys"],"artists":["John Mac Cambridge"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
