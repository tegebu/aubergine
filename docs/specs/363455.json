{"gameId":363455,"name":"Keydom's Dragons","description":"Dragons have plundered the land of Keydom for its treasures, which they are now hoarding in the network of caves around Keytown.&#10;&#10;In competition with other players, in Keydom's Dragons you lead a band of eight plucky townsfolk (workers). You will send some of your workers into the caves while the dragons are abroad in order to recover their treasure hoards piece by piece. Other workers will acquire help and assistance in the town, or attempt to find a way past the castle guards using strength or bribes, opening the way for your remaining workers to enter the castle rooms and spend the treasures your team has recovered to buy valuable artefacts.&#10;&#10;Once all of the castle's artefacts have been claimed, the player whose band has acquired the most artefacts is victorious, gaining recognition and renown throughout Keydom.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fayrx4Us3T3Njp9jO8YY_w__original/img/iUXPnA3Vxm5knYFZ8r_cfpfxS1s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6907592.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fayrx4Us3T3Njp9jO8YY_w__thumb/img/TZueokG4YPwxqoM15wBq1LdFzWs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6907592.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Auction/Bidding","Set Collection","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8,"rank":-1,"designers":["Richard Breese"],"publishers":["R&D Games"],"artists":["Vicki Dalton"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
