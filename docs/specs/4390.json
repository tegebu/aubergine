{"gameId":4390,"name":"Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers","description":"Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age.&#10;&#10;As in other Carcassonne games, players take turns placing tiles to create the landscape and placing meeples to score points from the map they're creating. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.&#10;&#10;It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:&#10;- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus (menhir) tiles.&#10;- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.&#10;- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.&#10;- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.&#10;&#10;The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion&#10;&#10;In the 2020 edition &#10;- Some of The Scout special tiles are transformed into menhir tiles of which there are more now.&#10;- A deer scores 1 point, an aurochs 2 points and a mammoth 3 points on meadows. &#10;- Rivers score for fish in the river segments as well, not only the fish in the lakes at each end. Fishing huts likewise.&#10;- Players each get 3 huts instead of just 2.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NSD4L9c-rY5OOlJYFlQ2Wg__original/img/pBCT2KKOuuSrj4OI5gybXzySnRo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5647234.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NSD4L9c-rY5OOlJYFlQ2Wg__thumb/img/4jFZqbcMUlrd-Nhy7IJHjTshbrc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5647234.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":35,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Map Addition","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2002,"bggRating":6.88945,"averageRating":7.13042,"rank":513,"designers":["Klaus-Jürgen Wrede","Bernd Brunnhofer"],"publishers":["Hans im Glück","999 Games","Albi","Asmodee","Devir","Hobby World","Lautapelit.fi","Mandoo Games","Midgaard Games","MINDOK","Rio Grande Games","Smart Ltd","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Z-Man Games"],"artists":["Marcel Gröber","Anne Pätzke","Chris Quilliams","Johann Rüttinger"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":101,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":94,"recommended":58,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":82,"recommended":57,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":35,"recommended":74,"notRecommended":19,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":10,"recommended":59,"notRecommended":51,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":79,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
