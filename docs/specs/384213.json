{"gameId":384213,"name":"Fromage","description":"You are a French cheesemaker in the early 20th century making, aging, and selling your artisanal cheeses. Become the most prestigious cheesemaker in all of France by running a highly successful creamery and crafting exceptional cheese.&#10;&#10;Fromage is a simultaneous worker-placement game where players place Workers to make cheese and gather resources from the quadrant of the board facing them. Once all players have placed their Workers, the board rotates, aging any cheese that was made, and presenting each player with a new quadrant to place Workers into. Score Prestige Points by selling cheese to the four locations, and by efficiently managing and upgrading your creamery.&#10;&#10;-description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/h87Ft6qXbzwPifN7WGnx2Q__original/img/X5va643QzqHpbIJIPUGv5jp4qGs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7452200.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/h87Ft6qXbzwPifN7WGnx2Q__thumb/img/0qK0Iu8ahtXtY4E8UFJib4hQ1hw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7452200.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Bias","Chaining","Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Simultaneous Action Selection","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":6.05259,"averageRating":7.63578,"rank":2697,"designers":["Matthew O'Malley","Ben Rosset"],"publishers":["Road To Infamy Games (R2i Games)"],"artists":["Pavel Zhovba"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":2,"recommended":12,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":14,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":7,"recommended":10,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":18,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
