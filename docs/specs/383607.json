{"gameId":383607,"name":"Barcelona","description":"It's the mid-19th century. The city of Barcelona is the most densely populated city in all of Europe. Shortly after the old city walls were finally destroyed, Ildefons Cerd&agrave;, who is now considered the inventor of urbanism, presented the plan for the creation of the &quot;Eixample&quot;, the expansion that Barcelona so desperately needed. Its construction began in 1860.&#10;&#10;In Barcelona, you will take on the role of builders in 19th-century Barcelona who are working on the new expansion to the city. Your main goal is to construct buildings to accommodate the citizens who want to leave the old city, and in the process, you will also build streets, create tram lines, and build public services. You may even decide to explore &quot;Modernisme&quot;, a new architectural and arts style that has been gaining popularity among the rich.&#10;&#10;Barcelona is played over a variable number of rounds interrupted by three scoring phases before a final scoring phase. Every round, each player takes a single turn consisting of two or more actions, a building phase, and then preparation for their next turn. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/clBx1kfB-8OpO86B2-vsgg__original/img/4Wmp2fgPbYKAfL4UC3QXSv9YATM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7442376.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/clBx1kfB-8OpO86B2-vsgg__thumb/img/8w625ctGlolYNodQdbXJtyOC3wg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7442376.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Tile Placement","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":6.66167,"averageRating":7.80914,"rank":918,"designers":["Dani Garcia"],"publishers":["Board&Dice","Albi","BO3 Studio","CMON Global Limited","Delta Vision Publishing","Giant Roc","HIT Games","Maldito Games","Mosaico Jogos","Pixie Games","TOP NOTCH"],"artists":["Zuzanna Kołakowska","Aleksander Zawada"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":3,"recommended":40,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":33,"recommended":42,"notRecommended":10,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":43,"recommended":29,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":13,"recommended":33,"notRecommended":38,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":37,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
