{"gameId":35570,"name":"Tinners' Trail","description":"Tinners' Trail is set in nineteenth century Cornwall. You are mining for copper and tin, attempting to sell when the prices are high. To reduce the cost of mining you can place developments, such as ports, adits, and trains. Once you have made your money you invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest the better the return.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zuh_7g6fUJDUkbIceT_wEw__original/img/IQcVH_ftaU0vTLCO2HOHnIjiXm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic464133.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zuh_7g6fUJDUkbIceT_wEw__thumb/img/GFKso8zlK2c73yUFCTdLITndS_U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic464133.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Auction/Bidding","Dice Rolling","Time Track"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2008,"bggRating":6.75216,"averageRating":7.26091,"rank":646,"designers":["Martin Wallace"],"publishers":["Treefrog Games","Broadway Toys LTD","IELLO","JKLM Games","Quined White Goblin Games","El Viejo Tercio","Warfrog Games"],"artists":["Peter Dennis","Andreas Resch"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":47,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":9,"notRecommended":42,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":22,"recommended":53,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":65,"recommended":24,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":34,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
