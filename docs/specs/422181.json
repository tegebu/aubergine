Can you help Peter defend his client? Each turn, read the trial card and choose an evidence card to refute it. Enter the evidence number into the web app and read the result: if it's correct, some jurors will side with you, and you can continue in the trial; if it's wrong, some jurors may side with your opponent, and you will have to try again. Depending on the evidence you choose, you may even receive personalized answers!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7UHLOqJW40X4zakTWvsdSA__original/img/WP6P6hPwdxnTBEx2pEdf5tNVE2I=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8235232.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7UHLOqJW40X4zakTWvsdSA__thumb/img/jgMwFjLK4wxQOgHOdU7EvNqOlNw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8235232.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Cooperative Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.40625,"rank":-1,"designers":["Enrico Procacci"],"publishers":["DV Games"],"artists":["Andrea Guerrieri","Idea Xu"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
