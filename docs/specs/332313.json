{"gameId":332313,"name":"Prison Architect: Cardboard County Penitentiary","description":"In Prison Architect: Cardboard County Penitentiary, one to four wardens compete to best ensure the security, health, and comfort of their prisoners. WIth no control over who is sentenced, for what, or for how long, your focus is on rehabilitating prisoners ready for their return to society.&#10;&#10;In each round of the game you will simultaneously bid on room tiles, staff cards and policy cards to improve your prison. By carefully placing tiles to maximise their benefits and negate their potentially-harmful effects, you can boost your prison&rsquo;s rehabilitative qualities and earn additional budget to spend on new facilities.&#10;&#10;When intaking prisoners, choose between prisoners with varying security requirements &ndash; with higher risk prisoners offering higher endgame rewards &ndash; all while balancing demanding Objectives to ensure your prison meets rigorous governmental standards.&#10;&#10;At the end of each game, the winner is the player who has earned the most victory points by rehabilitating prisoners, caring for unreleased prisoners, completing Objectives, and meeting conditions on tiles and Staff/Policy cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jyuQkXEn_n5hj81mw4ygDA__original/img/EXd-C3HvDP5OZPUazp0inn4V__I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6008803.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jyuQkXEn_n5hj81mw4ygDA__thumb/img/schvj3_XS7U6Qs0B0iJICtwCpzU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6008803.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Auction/Bidding","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":5.28571,"rank":-1,"designers":["Noralie Lubbers","DÃ¡vid Turczi"],"publishers":["Paradox Interactive (I)","PSC Games"],"artists":["Lewis Shaw"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
