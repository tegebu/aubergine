{"gameId":447670,"name":"Black Rose Wars: Revised Edition","description":"Turin, Year of Our Lord 1528&#10;&#10;To whomever dares to cross the threshold of the Lodge, Beware. The Lodge is not what it appears to be. It lives. It watches. It waits. Heresy runs deep within these ancient walls, entwined with the very stones that hold them up. Dark practices are whispered here &mdash; rituals shaped by forbidden knowledge, led by men who call themselves Perceivers. Their power grows unchecked. Their secrets fester beneath the surface. This place must be investigated. Observed. Judged. For corruption does not sleep &mdash; and neither shall we.&#10;&#10;In faith, Inquisitor&nbsp;Ezechiele&#10;&#10;Black Rose Wars is a competitive board game &mdash; a deck-building experience with area control elements, focused on magical combat and set within the dark and mysterious halls of the Black Rose Lodge. Each player takes on the role of a powerful Mage, master of their own School of Magic, chosen to compete in a deadly contest to become the next Grand Magister. But beware &mdash; the Black Rose is a sentient force and she will fight to preserve the status quo.&#10;&#10;The Revised edition features a fully rewritten rules set with Avatars, new room point scoring system, and new spells. There are new miniature prints and the artwork has been enhanced on both cards and boards.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ezZyJS4bS33XTWucAynAhw__original/img/SWQ0v3EZ7EhwfYyLJBDbspxoGg4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8936250.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ezZyJS4bS33XTWucAynAhw__thumb/img/N4Vl7k7bUVMnVSCk2fe5kW4NGHY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8936250.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Deck Construction","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Hand Management","Modular Board","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.74737,"rank":-1,"designers":["Marco Montanaro"],"publishers":["Ludus Magnus Studio"],"artists":["Henning Ludvigsen","Giovanni Pirrotta"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
