{"gameId":38855,"name":"Carcassonne: Expansion 7 – The Catapult","description":"The seventh &quot;large&quot; expansion for Carcassonne.&#10;12 new tiles with a faire symbol are added to the game. When a player draws a faire tile, they place it and then a &quot;catapult round&quot; begins. &#10;For the first time, action/dexterity is added to the Carcassonne series. In a catapult round, players attempt to launch special tokens with the wooden catapult. Players have one each of four different kinds of tokens that determine what kind of catapult action is to be taken:  Knock out tokens try to remove meeples; Seduction tokens try to swap meeples; Target tokens try to hit the faire tile; Catch tokens must be caught for points.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;    Carcassonne&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0zauOKpBtngNQVAIob8fFg__original/img/L58M1fnz9wlAchHc9pR2fGywnFc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic471370.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0zauOKpBtngNQVAIob8fFg__thumb/img/ANqIH2UTIRUfyYXVKG0rxir2j0E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic471370.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Flicking","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2008,"bggRating":5.19021,"averageRating":4.86879,"rank":-1,"designers":["Klaus-Jürgen Wrede"],"publishers":["999 Games","Bergsala Enigma (Enigma)","Devir","Giochi Uniti","Hans im Glück","Lautapelit.fi","MINDOK","Piatnik","Rio Grande Games","Schmidt France","Stupor Mundi","Venice Connection"],"artists":["Doris Matthäus"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":5,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":2,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":1,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
