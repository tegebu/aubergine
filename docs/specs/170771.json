{"gameId":170771,"name":"Sword & Sorcery","description":"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Sword &amp; Sorcery is an epic-fantasy cooperative board game in which 1-5 players fight together against the forces of evil, which are controlled by the game system itself.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one or more heroes &ndash; legendary characters brought back to life by powerful sorcery. Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes' souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.&#10;&#10;Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword &amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.&#10;&#10;Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword &amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword &amp; Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure.&#10;&#10;This base game contains ACT I of II.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNVnu-vB8WjyQTf63Ssvig__original/img/3zH2RQ0XlYefsMEa1Om1bnjNFS4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2673763.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNVnu-vB8WjyQTf63Ssvig__thumb/img/byFYJhsrFZ3Z5rd0Ef72GxmYoqM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2673763.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Points","Area Movement","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Role Playing","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2017,"bggRating":7.05081,"averageRating":7.95926,"rank":375,"designers":["Simone Romano","Nunzio Surace"],"publishers":["Ares Games","Gremlin Project","Devir","GaGa Games","Galakta","Heidelberger Spieleverlag","Intrafin Games","Planplay"],"artists":["Mario Barbati","Fabrizio Fiorentino","Phroilan Gardner","Fausto Gutierrez"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":55,"recommended":41,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":55,"recommended":49,"notRecommended":7,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":51,"recommended":54,"notRecommended":6,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":26,"recommended":62,"notRecommended":20,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":7,"recommended":28,"notRecommended":60,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":70,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
