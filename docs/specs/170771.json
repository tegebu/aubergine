Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes' souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.&#10;&#10;Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword &amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.&#10;&#10;Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword &amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles.
