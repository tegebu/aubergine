Use your resource cards and bonuses to construct building cards that require specific combinations. Build special civic structures to multiply your city's points and be the top urban planner!&#10;&#10;Point City takes the same simple concept of drafting cards and building the best combinations, then adds new layers of resource management and engine building to the mix &mdash; making the game easy to learn, but challenging for everyone!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-wcx_m4j86mTFAJ_kWz8eA__original/img/xqzKVJi-qRQAYHIUgpIz3kveNfQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6998174.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-wcx_m4j86mTFAJ_kWz8eA__thumb/img/wXCt7sv58rjfgCEeg_wX9NIiMpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6998174.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Open Drafting","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.11111,"rank":-1,"designers":["Molly Johnson","Robert Melvin","Shawn Stankewich"],"publishers":["Flatout Games","Alderac Entertainment Group","Lucky Duck Games"],"artists":["Dylan Mangini"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
