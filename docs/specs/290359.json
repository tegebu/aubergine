Take control of the British Army's Long Range Desert Group and operate behind enemy lines or command the formidable Italian forces opposing them. In &quot;Undaunted: North Africa&quot;, a sequel to Undaunted: Normandy, players once again lead their sides through a varied series of missions. As casualties mount, wounded soldiers leave the players' decks, forcing them to adapt in the face of changing tactical circumstances. Use your cards to strengthen your forces, deploy vehicles to advance rapidly across the battlefield, and seize the initiative as you determine the outcome of the North African Theater.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Zp0x_lURkRrHcLyyYv2aSw__original/img/xk-EPbXMZ8ut9LAMobKNsro6cSw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5536142.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Zp0x_lURkRrHcLyyYv2aSw__thumb/img/d9luLahO6n0itCfqpjpLexz24OE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5536142.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling","Modular Board","Simulation"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":6.44683,"averageRating":8.05079,"rank":1130,"designers":["Trevor Benjamin","David Thompson (I)"],"publishers":["Osprey Games","Do it games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Nuts!
