{"gameId":290681,"name":"Philadelphia 1777","description":"Philadelphia 1777 is a board wargame about the American Revolutionary War campaign led by British General Howe against the American colonist led by General Washington. It is a point to point movement war game using blocks with labels for the military units. The game uses the system from our previous games, New York 1776, Trenton 1776, and Saratoga 1777.&#10;&#10;Each turn both the American and British player will receive activation points with which to activate either groups of blocks moved by a leader, or individual blocks. When blocks of both sides end a move in a location together then a battle occurs.&#10;&#10;The game has some excellent historical &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; mixed in.&#10;&#10;There are lots of great strategic decisions for both sides in the game. Best of all it plays in 2 hours so you have time to play two games in an evening.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sk1wqBBcXA3q-EnCzO8IkQ__original/img/c76xYGWPe3ZKtdIk-CobwNhC-mo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4983441.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sk1wqBBcXA3q-EnCzO8IkQ__thumb/img/WdM23k0AZ1ZTM95fupP29ebkbP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4983441.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action Points","Dice Rolling","Movement Points","Point to Point Movement","Turn Order: Random"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.65217,"rank":-1,"designers":["Mike Wylie","Grant Wylie"],"publishers":["Worthington Publishing, LLC"],"artists":["Sean Cooke","Howard Pyle"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
