{"gameId":447384,"name":"Meister Makatsu","description":"In Meister Makatsu, players compete with their ninjas for the favor of the renowned master by demonstrating their mastery of perfect timing and strategic moves.&#10;&#10;Everyone has their own deck of 24 cards, with cards numbered 1-8 in three colors. You must play these cards wisely over three rounds because each turn whoever plays the highest card in a suit receives points equal to the round number. Played cards are removed from the game, whereas unplayed hand cards return to your deck for use in subsequent rounds.&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever has the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cB5otss5NgQoRsmW-Ju5kA__original/img/BJStZQUVQwaEhdnH6u6wPVNS6kk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8907902.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cB5otss5NgQoRsmW-Ju5kA__thumb/img/k0aed427brQX0RtC8-2p3Yl7kgw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8907902.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Hand Management"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["AMIGO"],"artists":["Sonja MÃ¼ller"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
