{"gameId":350184,"name":"Earth","description":"Earth is a tableau builder with simple rules and countless strategic possibilities. With its encyclopedic nature and a near-infinite number of tableau combinations, every single game will allow you to discover new synergies and connections, just as our vast and fascinating world allows us to do!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s time to jump into these rich environments and create some amazing natural synergies that replicate and extrapolate on Earth&rsquo;s amazing versatility and plethora of natural resources.  Over thousands of years of evolution and adaptation the flora and fauna of this unique planet have grown and developed into amazing life forms, creating symbiotic ecosystems and habitats.&#10;&#10;Players create a self-supporting engine of growth, expansion and supply where even your unused plants become compost for future growth. They use their cards to choose actions (which affect all players) and gain resources. The first player to complete their Tableau triggers the end of the game. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0xqF_KyOb7V26Lu5YT3fxw__original/img/uqxMcj1QPt-U34drYdL6mmv2eos=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6699821.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0xqF_KyOb7V26Lu5YT3fxw__thumb/img/ABTwzzMGekkz2jVl01LC4789TcQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6699821.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Contracts","End Game Bonuses","Follow","Hand Management","Pattern Building","Solo / Solitaire Game","Tags","Team-Based Game","Tile Placement","Variable Set-up","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":7.35496,"averageRating":7.6397,"rank":199,"designers":["Maxime Tardif"],"publishers":["Inside Up Games","Board Game Rookie","CoolPlay","Gém Klub Kft.","Geronimo Games","Lucky Duck Games","Ludofun","Maldito Games","MINDOK","Rawstone","リゴレ (rigoler)","Skellig Games","Tabletop KZ","Yellowstar Games","Ігромаг"],"artists":["M81 Studio","Conor McGoey","Yulia Sozonik","Kenneth Spond"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":38,"recommended":166,"notRecommended":52,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":177,"recommended":127,"notRecommended":18,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":149,"recommended":131,"notRecommended":9,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":68,"recommended":158,"notRecommended":47,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":14,"recommended":84,"notRecommended":131,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":2,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":157,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
