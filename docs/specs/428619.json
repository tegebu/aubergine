{"gameId":428619,"name":"Dungeons & Dragons: Builders of Baldur's Gate","description":"In Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Builders of Baldur's Gate, a city-building game from acclaimed designer Matthew Dunstan, you are the head of a powerful family in the iconic city. You grow your prestige by building new businesses within the nine districts, both as one large network and across all the districts. You must also extend your influence with the three main factions of the city: the Council of Four, the Flaming Fist, and the Thieves' Guild. But Baldur's Gate is not only a city of industry in the Forgotten Realms, but a city of mortal danger. Mobs of monsters regularly attack the outer walls or from the harbor, forcing temporary alliances to fend off the incursions. Each family tries to take advantage of the crises, using them as stepping stones to advance their own agendas.&#10;&#10;When you place buildings, you place an influence cube on them to indicate your control. This also applies to special keeps, gates, and watchtowers, which are represented by miniatures with slots for your influence cubes, allowing you to see the city grow in three dimensions!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PGPdGM-_h9uGUmyLa-3DnQ__original/img/AJvJiM2p8Yh8QstHllfhW6f_bbQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8418215.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PGPdGM-_h9uGUmyLa-3DnQ__thumb/img/FnoPOJGYp81QR50yQ6tpPp9jvD8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8418215.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":[],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.09618,"rank":-1,"designers":["Matthew Dunstan"],"publishers":["WizKids (I)"],"artists":["Gong Studios"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
