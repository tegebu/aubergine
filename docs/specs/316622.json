{"gameId":316622,"name":"Gods Love Dinosaurs","description":"How do you make an ecosystem flourish with just enough of every life form in the chain to supply you with dinosaurs to dominate the lands? Resources are scarce, animals can go extinct in an area, and everyone must eat to survive &mdash; so moves must be cunning. Life hangs in the balance...&#10;&#10;In Gods Love Dinosaurs, a cheeky, wild, and timeless take on the scientific tale as old as life itself, you are a god who has been tasked with designing an ecosystem with a sustainable food chain of predator and prey animals. But you just love dinosaurs, so all you really want to do is to make as many of them as possible!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you'll add one tile to your ecosystem, which will add new animals and give them room to grow. Every so often, your dinosaurs will tromp around your ecosystem eating all the animals. The more they eat, the more eggs they lay &mdash; and the more points you score! Just be careful not to overeat, or there won't be enough food to keep your dinosaurs alive the next time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0-D0fyKt7-_WzmuGGqN-Ag__original/img/m88IsXxkz--N2TXG2OHhQPlXnVw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5585737.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0-D0fyKt7-_WzmuGGqN-Ag__thumb/img/LSXue4qRfjykYuTo_kVpFjZd4c8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5585737.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["Drafting","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":5.902,"averageRating":7.37945,"rank":2925,"designers":["Kasper Lapp"],"publishers":["Pandasaurus Games"],"artists":["Gica Tam"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":6,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":5,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
