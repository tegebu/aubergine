{"gameId":396543,"name":"Havalandi","description":"You stand at the railing of the viewing pavilion, your gaze wandering into the distance. The soft colours around you glow in a soft light. From this beautiful location, fleets of your hot air balloons will soon dapple the sky with radiant hues. You couldn&lsquo;t be prouder, but as the horizon fills with these graceful flights of fancy, it will take  careful planning to make sure that your balloons attract the most attention.&#10;&#10;You are trying to score as many points as possible with clever placement of your balloons. Points are earned by launching the balloons of your fleets and forming the largest possible groups of your own balloons within the different regions. The launch sites at the pavilions are also highly coveted and offer you further opportunities to earn points. Choose the right launch site at the right time and score lots of points for your fleet!&#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/scQidYM_plj_QhSUr6i1Ew__original/img/hcKl9jX78yNNyNEVCZNqDiraxro=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7653473.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/scQidYM_plj_QhSUr6i1Ew__thumb/img/DpmOzp1lWzBkLpXD6dMetcpvsW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7653473.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Connections","Dice Rolling","End Game Bonuses","Hexagon Grid","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["Edition Spielwiese","Pegasus Spiele"],"artists":["Lukas Siegmon"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
