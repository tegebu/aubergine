{"gameId":422042,"name":"Tea Garden","description":"Tea Garden is a game of talented debuting designer Tom&aacute;&scaron; Holek, who is also working on his designs for the biggest Czech publishers. The key elements of the game are deck-building and worker-placement, Maybe the most intriguing is the resource management part though. In Tea Garden, you will pay with tea leaves. Those can be either green or black (fermented) &ndash; the value of green leaves decreases each round, but the value of black leaves increases. But you can&rsquo;t gain black leaves directly, you can just change the green leaves to the black leaves. This simple mechanism is vital to the unique dynamics of the game that it&rsquo;s so easy to fall for.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LIIX8JddEnTiwVV_cQ-mCA__original/img/6gQqWfyD1yZHfPi_4kBYfmaaczs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8238877.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LIIX8JddEnTiwVV_cQ-mCA__thumb/img/Gz04y-9W33ODQ2VxlpuVxahf7lM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8238877.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Automatic Resource Growth","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","End Game Bonuses","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":5.52552,"averageRating":8.07667,"rank":16091,"designers":["Tomáš Holek"],"publishers":["Albi"],"artists":["Barbora Srp Žižková"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
