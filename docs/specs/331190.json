{"gameId":331190,"name":"Meeples and Monsters","description":"The peaceful city of Rowan is surrounded by dangerous monsters. It&rsquo;s up to the citizens to fortify the city, train up warriors, clerics, knights, and mages, and defend Rowan in Meeples &amp; Monsters!&#10;&#10;Meeples &amp; Monsters is a big, beautiful bag-building engine builder by designer Ole Steiness (Champions of Midgard and more). Depth, replayability, beautiful components, and a splash of meeple humor will have you coming back for &ldquo;just one more play&rdquo; game night after game night!&#10;&#10;During a players turn, they draw meeples out their bag and use those meeples to perform various actions on the board. Those actions include upgrading your meeples, adding new meeples to your bag, fighting monsters, investigating towers, or even upgrading the town giving players even more options on future turns. At the end of a player&rsquo;s turn, all the meeples they drew are put onto the &ldquo;lodging&rdquo; part of the player&rsquo;s board.&#10; During the game, players will score victory points by defeating monsters, completing quests, and investigating towers. At the end of the game, players will score additional victory points by fighting boss monsters and through end of game quests. The player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;This Kickstarter edition includes a bunch of upgrades and extras, including the 4-towers expansion (20 tiles) and everything you need to play the solo version (7 Royal Guard Order Tiles, 1 Royal Guard Board). If a retail edition is created, it is likely these will not be included in it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m-JzEO_MQb7TQsV7XS1igA__original/img/VfhiQbN78O2co1bwfRIiKPuqZVA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5977790.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m-JzEO_MQb7TQsV7XS1igA__thumb/img/4I6OY6LBLyCofh9uAGR9CIXQ0-o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5977790.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.875,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ole Steiness"],"publishers":["Alderac Entertainment Group"],"artists":["Gong Studios","Brigette Indelicato"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
