{"gameId":337098,"name":"Dragonbond: Lords of Vaala","description":"A game of power based in the universe of Dragonbond.&#10;&#10;Raid as a dragon or raise armies as a general, destroy your enemies, and cast mighty spells, all to collect power. The player who collects 10 Power tokens, wins.&#10;&#10;During the game, a general and a dragon entering to the same region peacefully, have a chance of becoming Dragonbonded to unlock a unique ability that interacts with each other, and playing as a team for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase players secretly play action cards in a face-down pile to program their actions across the board until one player passes; in the resolution phase, actions are resolved in order. Through these actions, players move to different regions, attack, collect power or cast spells by spending the Power collected.&#10;&#10;Combat has a wargame feel into it due to the dice-based resolution with critical hits, counterattacks and retreats. If Power is scarce on the board, you can steal a Power token from another player entering into combat and dealing more hits than they can take.&#10;&#10;Dragons and generals play entirely different in strategy and actions. Generals raise armies and customize them in different regions around the board to control them and harvest Power. Dragons can gain Power by devouring units, they also have a health track and must rest and recover if they get wounded too much. All characters in the game have a unique Vaala deck of spells.&#10;&#10;In a world without gods, only you may claim your destiny.&#10;&#10;-description from developer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ul3cMwW8_7DQOmXHC75Ryw__original/img/db4yGNwtN7c8-lXZ4v9dPomBcSk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6272284.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ul3cMwW8_7DQOmXHC75Ryw__thumb/img/FJG3pBBtAb_PylMto2JBI3ZJDps=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6272284.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Queue","Action/Event","Area Majority / Influence","Command Cards","Critical Hits and Failures","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Programmed Movement","Semi-Cooperative Game","Variable Player Powers","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":5.5996,"averageRating":7.53661,"rank":8376,"designers":["Jack Caesar","Alessio Cavatore"],"publishers":["Draco Studios","River Horse (Europe) Ltd"],"artists":["Irene Aretia","Tom Babbey","Aldo Dom√≠nguez (Eyari)","Steve Prescott","Todd Ulrich","Tyler Walpole","Adam Wesierski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":1,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":7,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
