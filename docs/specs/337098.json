Once you have collected 10 power tokens, you win the game immediately.&#10;&#10;During the game, a general and a dragon in the same region have a chance of becoming Dragonbonded and playing as a team, sharing their power resource to cast spells and gaining a special ability, however, in order to win, both players require to collect 20 power in total.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase players secretly play action cards in a face-down pile to program their actions across the board until one player passes; in the resolution phase, actions are resolved in order.&#10;&#10;Dragons and generals play entirely different in strategy and actions. And all characters in the game have a unique deck of spells.&#10;&#10;In a world without gods, only you may claim your destiny.&#10;&#10;-description from developer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ul3cMwW8_7DQOmXHC75Ryw__original/img/db4yGNwtN7c8-lXZ4v9dPomBcSk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6272284.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ul3cMwW8_7DQOmXHC75Ryw__thumb/img/FJG3pBBtAb_PylMto2JBI3ZJDps=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6272284.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Area Majority / Influence","Command Cards","Critical Hits and Failures","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Programmed Movement","Semi-Cooperative Game","Variable Player Powers","Victory Points as a Resource"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.17647,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jack Caesar","Alessio Cavatore"],"publishers":["Draco Studios","River Horse Ltd."],"artists":["Irene Aretia","Tom Babbey","Aldo Dom√≠nguez (Eyari)","Steve Prescott","Adam Wesierski"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
