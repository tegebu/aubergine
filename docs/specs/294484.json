{"gameId":294484,"name":"Unmatched: Cobble & Fog","description":"In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched: Cobble &amp; Fog features four new heroes for the Unmatched system. Invisible Man uses fog to dart around the board and strike without warning. Sherlock, with the trusty Watson by his side, schemes and calculates to ensure victory. Dracula and the sisters slowly drain you of your power. Jekyll &amp; Hyde uses the former's cunning and the latter's brute strength to win the day.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iyIO6udRfIn0xM1rIxyO2g__original/img/PZBFIDjPGZddto7n5F5gP_2slUA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5056685.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iyIO6udRfIn0xM1rIxyO2g__thumb/img/oKVEm_nmurLwHbp9QPNNEyJkzeE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5056685.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Area Movement","Hand Management","Line of Sight","Take That","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2020,"bggRating":6.67021,"averageRating":8.39959,"rank":766,"designers":["Rob Daviau","Justin D.
