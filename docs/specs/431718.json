{"gameId":431718,"name":"The Isle of Cats Duel","description":"In The Isle of Cats Duel &mdash; a competitive, standalone game designed specifically for two players &mdash; you are citizens of Squalls End on a rescue mission to the Isle of Cats and must save as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives. Each cat is represented by a unique tile and belongs to a family; you must find a way to make them all fit on your boat while keeping families together.&#10;&#10;The Isle of Cats Duel replaces the card drafting from the original The Isle of Cats game with a new movement system. Guided by an Oshax cat, players take turns moving around the island. Where you move determines which cats, treasures, and lessons you can access and will shape the options available to your opponent on their next turn.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who best balances rescuing cats, completing lessons, and limiting their opponent's options will prove themselves as the ultimate cat rescuer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D5NehsOqprGSFkIcliIN9A__original/img/QSDaYU1zsz1gzVQnMpPY6Xx30aA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8515910.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D5NehsOqprGSFkIcliIN9A__thumb/img/BK6hn_TIO7HvtAf3ADZsW-gxKGE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8515910.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Grid Coverage","Pattern Building","Set Collection","Square Grid","Tile Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.40909,"rank":-1,"designers":["Frank West"],"publishers":["The City of Games"],"artists":["Dragolisco","Frank West"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
