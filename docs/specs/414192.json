{"gameId":414192,"name":"Knights of the Round Table","description":"In each game of Knights of the Round Table, players choose a cycle of Arthurian myth to play, setting the tone and starting rules. They rally a company of knights and Arthurian personalities, deploying them to construct Camelot, repel invader hordes, and quest for the Holy Grail. Through their choices, players sculpt a unique narrative and unlock new modules until the grail is discovered, and a winner is crowned high king!&#10;&#10;The game features dozens of silkscreened wood pieces, a huge game board, and a 3D castle that players build during play. Multiple game modules allow for high variability and replayability across many aspects of Arthurian myth, with the intertwining of themes and mechanisms allowing players to organically create their own spin on these legends.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_lnU46emEhp5NTBI8erKQ__original/img/HM8FHw-3Bm9MskQOm_hmmxA698E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8034071.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_lnU46emEhp5NTBI8erKQ__thumb/img/RdNz49fVrFeCGBYls8ThfiwV2Us=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8034071.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Chaining","Highest-Lowest Scoring","I Cut, You Choose","Turn Order: Pass Order","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jonny Pac"],"publishers":["Crafty Games"],"artists":["Dann May"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
