Space!: A Deck-Building Adventure","description":"The evil Lord Eradikus has all but conquered the galaxy and is now on a victory lap across the sector in his flagship, Eradikus Prime. He may rule with an iron grip, but his most prized artifacts are about to slip through his cyborg claws.

But one false step and &mdash; Clank! Careless noise draws the attention of Lord Eradikus. Hacking into his command module and stealing his artifacts increases his rage. You'd better hope your friends are louder than you are if you want to make it to an escape pod and get out alive...&#10;&#10;Clank! In! Space! is built on the same game system as Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure, with players building a personal deck of cards throughout the course of the game, with the cards allowing them to move through the spaceship, attack things, acquire new cards, and &mdash; oh yeah &mdash; make noise to attract Lord Eradikus and potentially seal their own doom.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/haDQw7X8Z0VOItfow9eDtg__original/img/Gq7eW_IFnUgIFcWcZSbWihAzdTs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3720843.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/haDQw7X8Z0VOItfow9eDtg__thumb/img/mn9ypbuCR2pwOSvor46QRXgVImM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3720843.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Modular Board","Player Elimination","Point to Point Movement","Push Your Luck"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2017,"bggRating":7.48854,"averageRating":7.85281,"rank":106,"designers":["Paul Dennen"],"publishers":["Dire Wolf","Renegade Game Studios","17wanzy (Yihu BG)","Lucrum Games","REXhry","Schwerkraft-Verlag"],"artists":["Rayph Beisner","Raul Ramos","Rastislav Le","Nate Storm","Franz Vohwinkel"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":8,"recommended":29,"notRecommended":52,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":14,"recommended":80,"notRecommended":14,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":73,"recommended":27,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":39,"recommended":53,"notRecommended":13,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":67,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
