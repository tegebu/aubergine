{"gameId":365717,"name":"Clank!: Catacombs","description":"The catacombs of the skeletal dragon Umbrok Vessna are mysterious and dangerous. Portals transport you all around the dungeon depths. Wayshrines offer vast riches to intrepid explorers. Prisoners are counting on you to free them. Ghosts, once disturbed, may haunt you to death. Despite all that, it's time to leave the board behind with Clank! Catacombs, a standalone deck-building adventure.&#10;&#10;Each trip into the catacombs is unique since you lay tiles to create the dungeon. You can play using only the all-new dungeon deck, or you can include cards from previous Clank! expansions.&#10;&#10;Find your fortune (and escape the dragon!) in Clank! Catacombs.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cCLn9Mvb7jRSaZzHeUXhoQ__original/img/NK4hsA9nc-kdI07hR0Nc23dL_bk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6937913.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cCLn9Mvb7jRSaZzHeUXhoQ__thumb/img/B8BFQLR2Po3ekI_7XSG1kR9oil0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6937913.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Delayed Purchase","End Game Bonuses","Movement Points","Open Drafting","Player Elimination","Point to Point Movement","Push Your Luck","Tile Placement","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":6.05743,"averageRating":8.4628,"rank":2431,"designers":["Paul Dennen"],"publishers":["Dire Wolf","Lucrum Games"],"artists":["Clay Brooks","Anika Burrell","Nate Storm","Dan Taylor (II)"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":3,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":3,"recommended":8,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":9,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":5,"recommended":5,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
