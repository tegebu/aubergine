{"gameId":436215,"name":"The Hobbit: There and Back Again","description":"The Hobbit: There &amp; Back Again is a competitive adventure game in which players draft dice to make pathways, collect resources, and perform actions that help them to reach their chapter goal.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each of the 1-4 players has their own adventure board book open to the same chapter of the game, and they play in turn order starting with the shortest player. That player rolls all of the dice, then selects one, then the next player selects one, and so on until all dice have been chosen, at which point the next player rolls all the dice once again.&#10;&#10;With your chosen dice, you use a dry-erase pen to mark the current chapter of your book, drafting a path to evade trolls, battle goblins, solve riddles, and pen the best conclusion to each chapter. The game takes players through the eight most iconic challenges faced by Bilbo and the Dwarves in The Hobbit, such as overcoming trolls, goblins, wargs, and giant spiders; reclaiming the treasure of the dwarves; and defeating the dragon Smaug. In the end, you want to complete the most rewarding journey to The Lonely Mountain.&#10;&#10;The Hobbit: There &amp; Back Again includes a solo mode, as well as a way to increase the game's difficulty, whether for some players to balance different skills levels or for everyone to increase the challenge.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KCsAkHzgdx9fL78c15N-dw__original/img/UrwVZtc6UJ9wO1_8lc7G2_NhAGU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8831592.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KCsAkHzgdx9fL78c15N-dw__thumb/img/Pswt1H_wQIyaaLAtUuRDkmKCCQA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8831592.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Open Drafting","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":8.25,"rank":-1,"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"publishers":["Office Dog","Rebel Sp. z o.o."],"artists":["Lorenzo Colangeli"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
