Command ships, crew, and away teams while you manage resources and alliances!&#10;&#10;Each of the six captains comes with a unique, asymmetric deck of cards themed to that captain's personality strategies, allies, and assets. Each deck creates different strategic directions based on which common cards are available and what strategy your opponent deploys. The captains to choose from are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Jean-Luc Picard&#10;     Benjamin Sisko&#10;     Michael Burnham&#10;     Koloth, The Dahar Master&#10;     Sela&#10;     Thy'lek Shran&#10;&#10;&#10;True to Star Trek, antagonism will not win every game. You will need to pursue diplomacy, exploration, and science, with different captains excelling at different paths. With hundreds of unique, deeply thematic cards, you'll want to explore the galaxy again and again! The chair is yours, Captain!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ft_wPFLBXESSipuF1-t8gQ__original/img/XboqICZYNz4Q0_6vKwAG8K8EN5w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8243925.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ft_wPFLBXESSipuF1-t8gQ__thumb/img/aHv8xdTra-JXSk0y77H-IXTvClY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8243925.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Solo / Solitaire Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":5.75786,"averageRating":8.77039,"rank":5015,"designers":["Nigel Buckle","DÃ¡vid Turczi"],"publishers":["WizKids (I)","Frosted Games"],"artists":["Gong Studios","Kurt Komoda"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":11,"recommended":2,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":10,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":2,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":11,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
