{"gameId":355433,"name":"boop.","description":"A deceptively cute, deceivingly challenging abstract strategy game for two players.&#10;&#10;Every time you place a kitten on the bed, it goes &ldquo;boop.&rdquo; Which is to say that it pushes every other kitten on the board one space away. Line up three kittens in a row to graduate them into cats&hellip; and then, get three cats in a row to win.&#10;&#10;But that isn&rsquo;t easy with both you AND your opponent constantly &ldquo;booping&rdquo; kittens around. It&rsquo;s like&hellip; herding cats!&#10;Can you &ldquo;boop&rdquo; your cats into position to win?&#10;Or will you just get &ldquo;booped&rdquo; right off the bed?&#10;&#10;&#10;     Approachable but challenging abstract game and a worthy follow-up to SHOBU. Plays in 20 to 30 minutes.&#10;     Features a quilted, fabric board that lays over the back of the box, completing the miniature bed playing surface. 8 wood kittens and cats per player - 32 adorable cat pieces in all!&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LPZHyg3KP_JI0x5CRut9lQ__original/img/qV7_RqqlgH_Cn_VXt8MLiGKC97U=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6643190.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LPZHyg3KP_JI0x5CRut9lQ__thumb/img/F1jYA7KSf96S5j7zRMD5t35GNb8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6643190.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Pattern Building","Slide/Push","Square Grid"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":5.86702,"averageRating":7.46219,"rank":3527,"designers":["Scott Brady"],"publishers":["Smirk & Laughter Games"],"artists":["Curt Covert"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":4,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":6,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":3,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
