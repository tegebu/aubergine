{"gameId":248760,"name":"NEXUS: Arena Combat System","description":"As immersive as it is breathtaking, NEXUS is a brutal and irreverent story-driven arena combat game that takes place on poorly maintained space barges. Packed with rabid and bloodthirsty fans, these barges feature an array of deadly hazards that are designed to indiscriminately kill or injure both combatants. These hazards range from floor saws that tear across the arena floors to pits that are home to monstrosities just looking for something to eat. Full of beautifully illustrated and amusingly inappropriate cards and lore, each match leaves you with a story to tell and laughs to be had by all.&#10;&#10;Gamers will appreciate the nostalgic art style and classic RPG elements that drive the brutal theme of the game. NEXUS puts classic tabletop gaming tools like dice, pen, and paper to good use; to pit genetically engineered champions against one another in visceral combat. Players will experience a rush as their dice rolls determine the fate of their hapless champions followed by thunderous bursts of laughter.&#10;&#10;The skirmish mode, while easily picked up by even the most novice of players, has just the right amount of depth, complexity, and self-generating narrative to make each match exhilarating. Dive even deeper with RPG legacy features and build your wealth and influence allowing for countless upgrades and bribes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F03HN68zs8nWnrJbQDVobA__original/img/FG-Uy1y62JaHk0zyoOPKY6gRh0I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4064506.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F03HN68zs8nWnrJbQDVobA__thumb/img/yIk3nD7Tkupv05GVW788UNzNf7U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4064506.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Action Points","Betting and Bluffing","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Paper-and-Pencil","Role Playing","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2022,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.32727,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jason Goike","J.
