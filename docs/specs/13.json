{"gameId":13,"name":"CATAN","description":"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resource-producing terrain types--or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6-sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their last-placed settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__original/img/xV7oisd3RQ8R-k18cdWAYthHXsA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2419375.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__thumb/img/8a9HeqFydO7Uun_le9bXWPnidcA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2419375.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Chaining","Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid","Income","Modular Board","Negotiation","Network and Route Building","Race","Random Production","Trading","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1995,"bggRating":6.91701,"averageRating":7.09618,"rank":566,"designers":["Klaus Teuber"],"publishers":["KOSMOS","999 Games","Albi","Asmodee","Astrel Games","BGA Plus","Brain Games","Broadway Toys LTD","Capcom Co., Ltd.","Catan Studio","Competo / Marektoy","danspil","Descartes Editeur","Devir","Dexy Co","Enigma (Bergsala Enigma)","Eurogames","Filosofia Éditions","Galakta","Giochi Uniti","GP Games","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos","HaKubia","Hanayama","Hobby World","Ideal Board Games","Igroljub","IntelliGames.BG","Ísöld ehf.","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames","L&M Games","Laser plus","Lautapelit.fi","Logojogos","Mayfair Games","MIPL","NeoTroy Games","Ninive Games","Paper Iyagi","Piatnik","Smart Ltd","Spilbræt.dk","Stupor Mundi","SuperHeated Neurons","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.","Tilsit","Top Toys","TRY SOFT","Vennerød Forlag AS"],"artists":["Volkan Baga","Tanja Donner","Pete Fenlon","Jason Hawkins","Michaela Kienle","Andreas Klober","Harald Lieske","Michael Menzel","Marion Pott","Andreas Resch","Matt Schwabel","Franz Vohwinkel","Stephen Graham Walsh"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":4,"notRecommended":1436,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":14,"recommended":245,"notRecommended":1283,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":684,"recommended":1083,"notRecommended":104,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1446,"recommended":444,"notRecommended":44,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":59,"recommended":192,"notRecommended":915,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
