{"gameId":421595,"name":"Lords of Heaven","description":"Vie for control of Jerusalem and the supremacy of the Middle East as one of the four major powers of the medieval world: the Latin Christian Crusaders, the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire, the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, or the Sunni Seljuks. Refight and change the history of the two first Crusades!&#10;&#10;Lords of Heaven is an area control and card placement game for 2-4 players. You, the leaders of each of the four asymmetric factions, will play action cards to take your actions such as build units, fortresses, and temples, move troops, fight battles, and develop your Middle East holdings.&#10;&#10;The game is a clever combination of rivalry and cooperation between two blocks of factions &ndash; Christian and Islamic &ndash; where combat and conquest are not always the best ways to achieve success. Politically nuanced and deeply steeped in its early crusades setting, Lords of Heaven will offer a couple of short scenarios and a campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Ht4cBDCfoveK9s6QTZlpw__original/img/qjrsTfyEkaIV0AEc9q0R9GvMdyw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic8219604.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Ht4cBDCfoveK9s6QTZlpw__thumb/img/16LAAn0XeDN11czHrWvYI633qJY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8219604.png","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"mechanics":["Action/Event","Alliances","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Auction/Bidding","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Card Play Conflict Resolution","Hand Management","King of the Hill","Semi-Cooperative Game","Worker Placement, Different Worker Types"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.33333,"rank":-1,"designers":["Aleksander Jagodziński"],"publishers":["PHALANX"],"artists":["Aleksander Jagodziński"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":1,"notRecommended":1,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":1,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
