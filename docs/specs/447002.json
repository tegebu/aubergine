{"gameId":447002,"name":"Sanibel","description":"In Sanibel, players walk up and down the beaches of this Florida island city, collecting a wide variety of seashells and carefully adding them to their bags &mdash; with your &quot;bag&quot; being a personal player board. As you collect shells, you &quot;drop&quot; them in the bag, letting them fall to the bottom Tetris-style. Focus on the types of shells and where they land, since they score in a variety of ways. Be sure to collect shark's teeth, too, as they're small and can fit in tiny spaces.&#10;&#10;Movement on the beach is represented by player tokens that start in a line, with a multitude of tiles splayed into zones on the beach. Whoever is at the back of the line takes the next turn, advancing as far as they wish, then collecting tiles. At the halfway point, players loop around and head back to where they started. At the end of the game, players earn points based on which seashells they picked up and how carefully they arranged them in their bag.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q75vVTPPTugVK7JH4XX0BA__original/img/SzXyVnY4bhgIMn-x0ZXBR4K5bAI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8897139.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q75vVTPPTugVK7JH4XX0BA__thumb/img/Hf6awfh-Cm9rAFH-HQRII3qLQ2o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8897139.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"mechanics":["End Game Bonuses","Open Drafting","Ordering","Pattern Building","Tile Placement","Turn Order: Time Track","Variable Set-up"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2026,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Elizabeth Hargrave"],"publishers":["Avalon Hill"],"artists":["Dahl Taylor"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
