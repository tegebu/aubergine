{"gameId":378500,"name":"HEXplore It: The Forests of Adrimon â€“ Fall of the Ancients","description":"This choose-your-own-path, board game/novel hybrid, offers a wondrous new way to experience the world of the Greenflame Forest amidst the return of the goddess Adrimon. Play through the Forests of Adrimon (Volume II) in an entirely new way and drive the unfolding of a complex and epic story with the heroes you choose at the story's core. Your heroes will be pulled into the narrative and their decisions will guide how the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;You will only experience a fraction of the content during each play-through, which means your games can unfold differently each time you play. Gain epic gear, unique campaign-only equipment and statuses, and power level your heroes throughout the entire length of the story. You will find that the allies you make, and the statuses and campaign items you gain may affect the story in completely different and unforeseeable ways in the future.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wj2GECbepxmMciVX_nw5TA__original/img/hMB5Di560p-SZCvTcL-qooAA3As=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7293631.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wj2GECbepxmMciVX_nw5TA__thumb/img/Er5u8Ygq_AVKQ-6OCwd0VjBmQz8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7293631.png","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":1200,"mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling","Events","Finale Ending","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Narrative Choice / Paragraph","Push Your Luck","Role Playing","Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game","Stat Check Resolution","Storytelling"],"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":2024,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":0,"rank":-1,"designers":["Jonathan Mariucci"],"publishers":["Mariucci J.
