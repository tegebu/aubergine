{"gameId":430814,"name":"Diplomacy: Era of Empire","description":"The 19th Century was a dynamic, yet turbulent time when huge areas of the Ottoman Empire, the Indian sub-continent, China, Indochina, and the East Indies were fought over by competing empires.&#10;&#10;In Diplomacy: Era of Empire, seven great empires &mdash; Britain, France, Russia, Turkey, China, Japan, and the Netherlands &mdash; vie for control as alliances are formed and trust is betrayed. Players negotiate and outwit one another in a delicate balance of co-operation and competition to gain dominance of the region. Players must rely on their own cunning and cleverness, not dice, to determine the outcome of this game of conspiracies and conquest.&#10;&#10;Diplomacy: Era of Empire is a standalone game for new or experienced Diplomacy players that's based on 1994's Colonial Diplomacy, but with an updated map for balance purposes, the removal of certain mechanisms that required three pages of errata, and other rule tweaks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Faqs6CrX0YMSFYTrA1Lbtw__original/img/j_9xFmZvSvHlpSCgzmIHU70SOOY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic8484358.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Faqs6CrX0YMSFYTrA1Lbtw__thumb/img/zoiELs42RADdHcVkfJcMTkvsaYo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic8484358.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":7,"playingTime":240,"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Negotiation","Player Elimination","Prisoner's Dilemma","Simulation","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2025,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7,"rank":-1,"designers":["Thomas Haver","Peter Hawes"],"publishers":["Renegade Game Studios"],"artists":["Janos Orban"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":7,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
