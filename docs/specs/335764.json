{"gameId":335764,"name":"Unmatched: Battle of Legends, Volume Two","description":"In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;Battle of Legends, Volume Two features four heroes: Yennenga, Achilles, Sun Wukong, and Bloody Mary.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh&auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.&#10;&#10;The game includes a new battlefield with a brand new mechanism, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Zoe van Dijk and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bN_c00S2ru5_MUB1MWgEag__original/img/aThItjLVA4-EbrDTxYDhK_WIlV0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6269292.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bN_c00S2ru5_MUB1MWgEag__thumb/img/6V24wI1xZZ3aWmFLn1yY3tmTib0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6269292.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":40,"mechanics":["Area Movement","Hand Management","Team-Based Game","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":7.66667,"rank":-1,"designers":["Noah Cohen","Rob Daviau","Justin D.
