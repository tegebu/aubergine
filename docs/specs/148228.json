{"gameId":148228,"name":"Splendor","description":"Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops&mdash;all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rwOMxx4q5yuElIvo-1-OFw__original/img/Y2tUGY2nPTGd_epJYKQXPkQD8AM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1904079.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rwOMxx4q5yuElIvo-1-OFw__thumb/img/D4hkkHfOgu22PwgJomjplWAveuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1904079.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"mechanics":["Card Drafting","Contracts","Race","Set Collection"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2014,"bggRating":7.33301,"averageRating":7.44787,"rank":171,"designers":["Marc André"],"publishers":["Space Cowboys","Asmodee","Asmodee China","Asterion Press","Baborka Games","Board Game VN","Boardgame Space","Broadway Toys LTD","Days of Wonder","Filosofia Éditions","Galápagos Jogos","Gém Klub Kft.","GoKids 玩樂小子","HaKubia","Hobby Japan","JD Éditions","Kaissa Chess & Games","Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.","Lautapelit.fi","Lex Games","Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd","Morapiaf","NeoTroy Games","Rebel Sp. z o.o.","Siam Board Games","Z-Man Games, Inc."],"artists":["Abbas Amirabadi","Mahmoud Arasteh Nasab","Pascal Quidault"],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":1,"recommended":11,"notRecommended":483,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":270,"recommended":436,"notRecommended":57,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":413,"recommended":324,"notRecommended":12,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":262,"recommended":409,"notRecommended":61,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":2,"recommended":19,"notRecommended":385,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
