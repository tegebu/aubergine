{"gameId":396695,"name":"Tiny Laser Heist","description":"A high stakes, 3D heist game!&#10;&#10;Everyone at the table is a career criminal eyeing retirement. Whether you&rsquo;re the mastermind or hired hand, you want to get involved in as many jobs as possible and make as much money as you can.  Walk away from a series of jewel heists as the winner with the most money by cooperating with other burglars to break into a vault. Work together to physically move &ldquo;padlocks&rdquo; using tiny hands and steal the jewels they&rsquo;re protecting. The harder the heist, the bigger the payout &ndash; whoever ends up with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;During each turn of Tiny Laser Heist, a player becomes the Mastermind and selects his team.  Players not selected now play against the team to stop the heist.  Both teams play action cards to determine the teams abilities and obstacles the team must face during the heist.  The team then has 90 seconds to steal the jewels.  If the you do, the Mastermind picks up and distributes money cards to his team members. Play continues until all the money is gone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/f9KjmDB5rHxToYngajDGfw__original/img/mkp6LZKT1d-zRxt9h4uiv8qeU6Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7646680.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/f9KjmDB5rHxToYngajDGfw__thumb/img/mc4cfeGIX13SvCj5A3LW3hcpizo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7646680.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":90,"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Action/Event","Negotiation","Take That","Team-Based Game"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2023,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":10,"rank":-1,"designers":[],"publishers":["Evan and Josh's Very Special Games Company"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":5,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":6,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
