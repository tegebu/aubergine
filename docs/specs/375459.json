{"gameId":375459,"name":"Speakeasy","description":"Speakeasy will transport you to the roaring 1920s during the era of Prohibition. Manhattan was under the firm control of Lucky Luciano, a prominent mobster. To strengthen his grip on the territory, he implemented a well-structured system. He divided Manhattan into different districts, each assigned to a specific mobster responsible for handling their &quot;business&quot; operations.&#10;&#10;These mobsters operated under a non-aggression pact, which meant they refrained from attacking each other and co-operated when needed. This agreement ensured a relatively peaceful coexistence among them, allowing them to focus on expanding their operations without internal conflicts. To maintain order and prevent newcomers from encroaching on their territories, the mobsters heavily guarded their controlled areas. Any unauthorized attempt to establish a presence was met with hostility. As a result, only those within the existing network could participate in the lucrative world of illegal activities during the Prohibition Era.&#10;&#10;Their thriving empire and lucrative activities, such as bootlegging and gambling, brought them substantial profits. Lucky Luciano ensured that each mobster received a share of the overall revenue based on their performance and the efficiency of their operations. The success of their empire relied on effective organization, co-operation, and loyalty to the system established by Lucky Luciano.&#10;&#10;Despite the criminal nature of their activities, they were skilled entrepreneurs who managed their criminal empires with strategic precision, making them formidable forces in Manhattan's underground during the Prohibition Era.&#10;&#10;In this worker-placement and card-management game, you take on the role of one of those mobsters, managing and operating your very own speakeasy empire in Manhattan.
