Be on the lookout...&#10;&#10;Welcome, weary traveler, to the town of Gallow Springs - the only &quot;civilized&quot; town on the entire Dethelm Frontier. Surrounded by bandits, predators, and cultists, only the toughest survive. If you&rsquo;re going to last, you must find a source of income, purchase new gear, build shelter, recruit a posse, and protect your homestead. Do you have what it takes?&#10;&#10;Bantam West is an immersive sim adventure board game for 2-4 players set in the wild frontier. Brawl, loot, burn, and trade as one of four deadly strangers in this open-world sandbox. As you wake each day, you must form a plan and play on your character&rsquo;s unique strengths, weaknesses, and personality to outperform the competition. Whether you live the life of a powerful merchant, an agile gunslinger, a malicious arsonist, or a stealthy thief, there is a unique way for you to come out on top.&#10;&#10;To win, you must gain Notoriety in town. You accomplish this by completing tasks, rolling dice, managing cards, and deciding how to spend your action points. Eventually, you will build small-time enterprises into corporations operating deep in the frontier. Along the way, be on the lookout for enemies and rival players who are aiming to fight you, burn your cabins down, and steal your hard-earned wealth!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YXTITLj-2mlYemlXGE3V5A__original/img/V_9P6I-_tr1Zqp46PKiFyEHMpEg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5948659.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YXTITLj-2mlYemlXGE3V5A__thumb/img/hnB1ZVhK8jcZMzGA44w3sFlmS1Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5948659.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":180,"mechanics":["Action Points","Dice Rolling","Events","Hand Management","Line of Sight","Market","Modular Board","Role Playing","Variable Player Powers","Variable Set-up","Worker Placement"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2021,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":9.71429,"rank":-1,"designers":["Ike Brunicardi"],"publishers":["Bantam Planet"],"artists":[],"playerPollResults":[{"numPlayers":1,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":2,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":3,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":false},{"numPlayers":4,"best":0,"recommended":0,"notRecommended":0,"numPlayersIsAndHigher":true}]}
