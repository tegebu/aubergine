{"gameId":4174,"name":"Lifeboat","description":"from original publishers' Web site&#10;&#10;Adrift in uncharted waters, six people share a tiny lifeboat. As the supplies run low, they discover that some barrels are filled with jewels and art treasures instead of water or hardtack. Greed mixes with love and hatred as the passengers take sides...&#10;&#10;Lifeboat is a fast-paced card game of intrigue and survival. Players vie for the highest score when the boat reaches land &mdash; a seemingly simple matter of surviving with the most treasure. But each player has a secret love and a secret enemy among the passengers, and no one knows when landfall will occur.&#10;&#10;Will you help row, and thus have a hand in guiding the boat's course? Try to shove your way into the quartermaster's seat? Start a fight to grab some loot? Or just bide your time until you can nudge your enemy overboard into shark-infested waters?&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3TqZjiMveplU3C6D-zWu4g__original/img/3FiIGTBYyBeo_NMKsOkPz0jKCnM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic236080.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3TqZjiMveplU3C6D-zWu4g__thumb/img/iWlHLWNCsOJ4ti7jq68qSAR5thw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic236080.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"mechanics":["Hand Management","Move Through Deck","Open Drafting","Player Elimination","Secret Unit Deployment","Set Collection","Take That","Team-Based Game","Trading","Variable Player Powers"],"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2002,"bggRating":5.94981,"averageRating":6.298,"rank":3327,"designers":["Jeff Siadek"],"publishers":["Fat Messiah Games","Gorilla Games","Berserkr Jogos","Edgard Games","Games7Days","Gen-X Games","Le Joueur","Magellan","Swan Panasia Co., Ltd."],"artists":["Stephen K.
